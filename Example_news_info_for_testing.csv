Now, the firm is expanding, with the aim of reaching more Americans in smaller cities and towns.
JPMorgan recently announced a new goal within its multibillion-dollar branch expansion plan that ensures coverage is within an “accessible drive time” for half the population in the lower 48 states. That requires new locations in areas that are less densely populated — a focus for Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon as he embarks on his 14th annual bus tour Monday.
Dimon’s first stop is in Iowa, where the bank plans to open 25 more branches by 2030.
“From promoting community development to helping small businesses and teaching financial management skills and tools, we strive to extend the full force of the firm to all of the communities we serve,” Dimon said in a statement.
He will also travel to Minnesota, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas this week. Across those six states, the bank has plans to open more than 125 new branches, according to Jennifer Roberts, CEO of Chase Consumer Banking.
“We’re still at very low single-digit branch share, and we know that in order for us to really optimize our investment in these communities, we need to be at a higher branch share,” Roberts said in an interview with CNBC. Roberts is traveling alongside Dimon across the Midwest for the bus tour.
Roberts said the goal is to reach “optimal branch share,” which in some newer markets amounts to “more than double” current levels.

The Japanese government ordered Toyota Motor on Wednesday to make “drastic reforms” after discovering new violations in the automaker’s vehicle certification procedures.
In a so-called corrective order, the Transport Ministry said on-site inspections had uncovered widespread, intentional misconduct and irregularities in seven additional models that had not been previously disclosed.
Toyota (TM) said the corrective order instructed it to “make drastic reforms to ensure appropriate certification operations.”
The automaker added it was in the process of confirming compliance with requirements for the models involved, and that customers did not need to stop using affected vehicles.
In July, Toyota said it had not found any new cases of wrongdoing in car model certification applications beyond the ones it had already reported in June.
Toyota and four other vehicle makers admitted in June they had submitted either flawed or manipulated data when applying for certification of vehicles.
Toyota’s wrongdoing involved three production models — the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross — and discontinued versions of four other models, including one sold under the luxury Lexus brand.
Toyota said it was planning to resume production of these models from the beginning of September after the Transport Ministry confirmed they met compliance requirements.
The Japanese automakers conducted the investigation after the ministry ordered industry-wide checks of certification practices following a safety test scandal at Toyota’s Daihatsu compact car unit.
The ministry said six of the seven additional Toyota models with irregularities were also certified in other countries, and it had alerted overseas authorities about the issues.
Four of the additional models — a minivan sold under the names of Noah and Voxy, and the RAV4, Harrier, and Lexus LM — are still in production by Toyota while three are no longer manufactured.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/31/cars/japan-reforms-toyota-certification-violations-hnk-intl/index.html

The route will be an add-on from Belo Horizonte to Curacao.
This provides a unique vacation option for tourists to visit Curacao and then shop in Fort Lauderdale.
Brazilian carrier Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras S/A (more commonly known as Azul) will launch a fifth freedom service between the Dutch Caribbean and Florida on December 9 with an Airbus A320neo . The route will be served four times weekly by an Airbus A320 aircraft.
The new flight will double the current connections between Belo Horizonte/Confins–Tancredo Neves International Airport (CNF), Brazil, and Curaçao International Airport (CUR), increasing from two to four flights per week. As a result, there will be onward flights to Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport (FLL) on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.
Four times a week
Azul initiated the route between Belo Horizonte and Curaçao last June, with just one service per week. By October 2023, this was increased to two flights per week, and has seen a good level of demand. A strong backing to ensure the success of the route has been commended to the Curaçao Tourist Board (CTB), Curaçao Airport Partners (CAP), Curaçao Airport Holding (CAH) and Curaçao Hospitality & Tourism Association (CHATA).

The Institutional Relations Manager at Azul, Mr. César Grandolfo, indicated that the increase in services is the result of strong demand:
“Curaçao is already a highly desired vacation destination; it is an island with a pleasant climate and can be visited at any time of the year. Now, we will additionally include a connection to the flight, allowing, for example, tourists to visit Curaçao and then go shopping in Fort Lauderdale using the same ticket.”

Description: In recent months, Airbus has been making investments and securing stability in its production facilities in Canada, the home of the A220. content: Summary For a long time, Airbus has considered stretching the A220.
Rumors about a potential A220 have been around for several years.
However, Airbus has prioritized the stability of its operations and supply chain at its Mirabel, Quabec, Canada, assembly site.
In 2023, Airbus and its executives had publicly admitted that it was looking into the possibility of stretching the A220-300, introducing either the A220-500, A221, or whatever variation of the A220 it would choose for the stretched aircraft.
Since then, the rumors about the stretched A220 have largely wound down. Largely because the aircraft manufacturer’s priorities have shifted elsewhere, namely making sure that its supply chain can handle its currently planned monthly rate ramp-ups for all of its aircraft programs.
A220 aircraft family A320neo aircraft family A330neo aircraft family A350 aircraft family Planned aircraft production rate (monthly) 14 by 2026 75 by 2027 4 by the end of 2024 12 by 2028
Rumor mill swinging
Rumors began circulating about a potential A220 stretch in 2019, before the pandemic, as Airbus moved to acquire a majority shareholding in the aircraft program, which started out as the Bombardier CSeries.
However, as Bombardier had accumulated debt to pursue the launch of the CSeries, it was eventually forced to sell an initial stake to Airbus and, later, exit the program completely.
Photo: StockPhotosLV | Shutterstock
The European manufacturer secured 75% of the aircraft program, which at that point was already renamed to the A220 in February 2020. The other 25% has been owned by the Government of Québec, with the two stakeholders sharing ownership of a company called Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (ACLP).
But for the A220 stretch, the timing has always been off, as the aviation industry has faced a crisis after a crisis.

Cebu Pacific reshuffles services to focus on destinations with higher demand, such as more flights to Melbourne and northern Thailand.
Southeast Asia has taken longer than any other region to recover to pre-pandemic levels, hampered by the extended and strict travel restrictions in Northeast Asia that deprived it of the inbound leisure and business traffic it had relied on. That's all in the past, and now the airlines in the region have returned most of their aircraft capacity, it is once again close to pre-COVID levels.
More flights to Melbourne
On Friday, Melbourne Airport (MEL) announced that the Philippine's low-cost carrier, Cebu Pacific, will increase services between Manila and Melbourne in December. To meet growing demand, Cebu Pacific is adding an additional weekly flight, and when that commences, it will operate the route four times weekly with its Airbus A330neo widebody jets.

The additional Cebu Pacific (Cebu) service will take capacity in the Philippines market above pre-pandemic levels for the first time, mirroring the shift at Melbourne Airport, which has firmly transitioned from recovery to growth. Cebu currently operates the route three times weekly, and the increase is a good indicator of the recovery in Southeast Asian air travel.

That delivery should have occurred in the first half of the year, but was pushed back amid supply chain issues. However, recent reports suggest it is already reducing its expectations for deliveries this year, as the number of aircraft to be received has dropped from six to just four.
Allegiant is revising the number of aircraft to be delivered this year
Allegiant was initially scheduled to receive six aircraft from Boeing this fall, but as reported by ch-aviation, the delivery has now been revised to just four. This alteration comes after a one-year delay, as the initial airframe deliveries were anticipated in 2023.
The airline had originally planned to receive 12 Boeing 737 Max in 2024, so the outlook has changed significantly.
ch-aviation reporting suggests that the airline will get its first Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 in September. However, it is preparing for an extended delivery schedule and projects a reduced rate of deliveries in 2025 and 2026, alleviating Allegiant's short- and medium-term capital requirements.

During the airline's recent investors call, chief financial officer, Robert Neal, provided some additional insight into the delays. He noted that the FAA had opted to retain the certification of Allegiant's first MAX, rather than delegating this to Boeing.
This results in a more extended timeline, but also gives the carrier a more straightforward path to delivery. As such, the first aircraft is expected in approximately 30 days.
Why are the 737 MAX deliveries delayed?
Essentially, these delays can be explained by two significant issues affecting Boeing's production...

The plane made a safe landing, and no injuries were reported.
Lightning strikes on airplanes are not uncommon, with incidents occurring more frequently than many realize.
Modern planes are equipped with features like static wicks to counteract static charges from lightning strikes.
A transatlantic flight by Delta Air Lines had to return to Boston following a lightning strike on Sunday evening. Airplanes are made to withstand lightning strikes, and Delta's decision to turn around the A330 was apparently taken to err on the side of caution.
Delta flight returns after lightning strike
On August 4, a Delta Air Lines flight between Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO) had to turn back after being struck by lightning. The aircraft involved in the incident was a 7.4-year-old Airbus A330-300, registered N831NW.
It was performing flight DL112 between Boston and Rome, with a scheduled departure time of 18:10 and an arrival of 08:15 local time. The aircraft made a safe landing in Boston with no reported injuries. Fire trucks were deployed at the airport in case of an emergency.
Delta Air Lines was said to be making arrangements for passengers bound for Rome. WCVB quotes an airline representative as saying,
“Delta flight 112 operating from Boston to Rome returned to Boston out of an abundance of caution after encountering lightning. The flight landed safely and without further incident. We apologize for the delay in their travel. The safety of our customers and people remains Delta's most important priority.”

Intel,8983,2024-08-05T16:45:27Z,"Things Are So Bad at Intel That the Boss Is Posting Bible Verses Description: U.S. trading was a bloodbath on Monday as stocks tumbled, online brokerages went dark, and fears of a recession loomed. content: In a sure sign that a stable hand is at the wheel, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is tweeting out inspirational Bible verses. Intel’s stock plummeted at the end of last week, but it was in good company as the rest of the market raced after it in a chaotic start to trading for the week. Trading platforms added to the chaos after three of them went down during a panicked sell-off during the early hours of trading.
Sunday afternoon, Gelsinger quoted Proverbs—the New International Version translation. The bit of poetry came amidst a collapsing stock price at Intel following the news that the company had missed quarterly targets and would cut thousands of jobs.
“Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways” Proverbs 4:25-26 — Pat Gelsinger (@PGelsinger) August 4, 2024
“Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways,” Gelsinger posted, quoting Proverbs verse 4, lines 25 and 26.
Verse 4 is a bit from King Solomon where he gives out fatherly advice to his sons. The whole thing is an entreaty to the reader to stay on the straight and narrow, and avoid wicked thoughts and corrupt speech. Basically, keep your mouth shut and your eye on the prize.
Tweeting out Bible verses isn’t a good way to calm investor panic. Amid a consumer scandal and a changing chip market, news broke last week that Intel would cut thousands of jobs. When the chip manufacturer finally reported its quarterly earnings to investors on Thursday, the fallout was worse than expected.
Following the news that Intel would fall short of its projected earnings, the stock price took a tumble settling down 26% on Friday. It was Intel’s largest stock loss in 50 years. Intel said it would restructure its business and is looking to cut billions in costs, including 15% of its workforce.

On Apple’s computers however, you can actually read the instructions programmed into the model supporting some of those Apple Intelligence features.
They show up as prompts that precede anything you say to a chatbot by default, and we’ve seen them uncovered for AI tools like Microsoft Bing and DALL-E before. Now a member of the macOS 15.1 beta subreddit posted that they’d discovered the files containing those backend prompts. You can’t alter any of the files, but they do give an early hint at how the sausage is made.
In the example above, an AI bot for a “helpful mail assistant” is being told how to ask a series of questions based on the content of an email. It could be part of Apple’s Smart Reply feature, which can go on to suggest possible replies for you.

This sounds like Apple’s “Rewrite” feature, one of the Writing Tools that you can access by highlighting text and right-clicking (or, in iOS, long-pressing) on it. Its instructions include passages saying “Please limit the answer within 50 words. Do not hallucinate. Do not make up factual information.”

Kean Birch is director of the Institute for Technoscience & Society and Ontario Research Chair in Science Policy at York University.
For the past couple of weeks, the share value of the S&P 500′s bellwether tech stocks has been falling. These include Alphabet Inc. GOOGL-Q, Apple Inc. AAPL-Q, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN-Q, Meta Platforms Inc. META-Q, Microsoft Corp. MSFT-Q, Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q, and Tesla Inc. TSLA-Q. As these seven corporations now represent a significant proportion of the U.S. stock market, any decline in value pushes down the overall public market, and this has been causing some panic.
On Monday that panic evolved into pandemonium. Global markets tumbled, but Big Tech tumbled more. At one point, the AI standard-bearer Nvidia was down more than 7 per cent and the Magnificent Seven lost more than US$500-billion in market capitalization.
The question of why this is happening now is interesting: It looks like the generative AI bubble is finally bursting.
I wrote in April this year that generative AI technologies look like money pits with significant social costs attached: this prediction seems increasingly on point. Investors are less and less confident that generative AI technologies will provide the necessary returns on the huge investments made.
Several analyst and investor reports have come out recently making similar points. First, David Cahn at the venture capital firm Sequoia argued that generative AI needs to generate US$600-billion in revenues to pay back current infrastructure spending – and we’re nowhere near this. Then, Jim Covello, Head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, argued that, in light of future expected infrastructure investment, generative AI needs to find a “$1-trillion problem” it will solve. It’s still not clear what this could be. Finally, the hedge fund Elliott Management has stated that Nvidia is in an AI “bubble land”",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-end-of-the-generative-artificial-intelligence-bubble/

The Mag Seven index fell the most since July 24. Together, the group of stocks make up more than 40% of the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) weighting.

Ecommerce giant Amazon (AMZN) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT) also slid.
Individual company news also put pressure on the Mag Seven stocks.

On Monday a judge found Alphabet's Google search and ad businesses violated antitrust laws, sending shares lower during the session.
Apple (AAPL) dropped more than 4% amid the broader market sell-off and after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) revealed over the weekend it had cut half of its stake in the iPhone maker.
Nvidia fell as much as 13% at the market open to pare some of its losses. Analysts noted recent negative catalysts weighing on the AI chip heavyweight.
The Information reported the company's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting its biggest customers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.
""Nvidia has a window to sell to Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta while those companies are hot and bothered about building out data centers as quickly as they can. That window will shut at some point,"" Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson senior software analyst, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.

Kean Birch is director of the Institute for Technoscience & Society and Ontario Research Chair in Science Policy at York University.
For the past couple of weeks, the share value of the S&P 500′s bellwether tech stocks has been falling. These include Alphabet Inc. GOOGL-Q, Apple Inc. AAPL-Q, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN-Q, Meta Platforms Inc. META-Q, Microsoft Corp. MSFT-Q, Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q, and Tesla Inc. TSLA-Q. As these seven corporations now represent a significant proportion of the U.S. stock market, any decline in value pushes down the overall public market, and this has been causing some panic.
On Monday that panic evolved into pandemonium. Global markets tumbled, but Big Tech tumbled more. At one point, the AI standard-bearer Nvidia was down more than 7 per cent and the Magnificent Seven lost more than US$500-billion in market capitalization.
The question of why this is happening now is interesting: It looks like the generative AI bubble is finally bursting.
I wrote in April this year that generative AI technologies look like money pits with significant social costs attached: this prediction seems increasingly on point. Investors are less and less confident that generative AI technologies will provide the necessary returns on the huge investments made.
Several analyst and investor reports have come out recently making similar points. First, David Cahn at the venture capital firm Sequoia argued that generative AI needs to generate US$600-billion in revenues to pay back current infrastructure spending – and we’re nowhere near this. Then, Jim Covello, Head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, argued that, in light of future expected infrastructure investment, generative AI needs to find a “$1-trillion problem” it will solve. It’s still not clear what this could be. Finally, the hedge fund Elliott Management has stated that Nvidia is in an AI “bubble land”",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-the-end-of-the-generative-artificial-intelligence-bubble/

Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic cancer, with an estimated 66,200 new U.S. cases in 2023. This approval demonstrates the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly targeting PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1), a crucial factor in tumor immune evasion. Studying PD-L1 is essential for developing therapies that enhance immune responses to various cancers, potentially improving treatment success and patient outcomes.
Mechanism of action of Durvalumab. Image Credit: Sino Biological
Mechanism of action
Durvalumab targets PD-L1, a key immune checkpoint. Normally, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recognize cancer cell antigens and activate cytotoxic T cells, which travel to the tumor site for eradication. However, tumors enhance their survival by suppressing these T-cell responses via PD-L1.
PD-L1, a type 1 transmembrane protein, is induced by inflammatory signals such as IFN-gamma and is found on both tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. It inhibits T cell activation and function by binding to PD-1 and CD80 receptors on T cells, reducing the immune response.
By binding to PD-L1, Durvalumab blocks its interactions with PD-1 and CD80, reactivating the cytotoxic T cells and enabling them to effectively target and destroy tumor cells. Durvalumab’s specificity for PD-L1, without affecting PD-L2, enhances its ability to potentiate the immune response against tumors, highlighting its role in countering cancer's immune evasion tactics.
PD-L1 as drug target
PD-L1 is a crucial immune checkpoint protein that modulates immune responses by binding to PD-1 on T cells, suppressing their activity and allowing tumors to evade immune detection. PD-L2, a related protein, also interacts with PD-1, contributing to immune regulation but with a different expression pattern and role. Both PD-L1 and ",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240805/FDA-accepted-PD-L1-inhibitor-durvalumab-for-the-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer.aspx

Police in Paris said they have opened a hate speech investigation after Jolly made a complaint to prosecutors Tuesday about the amount of death threats he's received since last Friday's opening ceremony, multiple outlets reported. Jolly told police he has been “the target of threatening messages and insults on social networks criticizing his sexual orientation and his wrongly-assumed Israeli roots."" Barbara Butch, the lesbian activist and LGBTQ+ icon who anchored the controversial skit, has also received threats that are being investigated for online abuse and harassment, according to France 24.

Conversation surrounding the Olympic opening ceremony in Paris quickly turned controversial last week after Butch donned a silver, halo-like headdress in a skit while seated in the center of a table with drag artists on a footbridge, while parading athletes floated underneath on the Seine.

“Thomas Jolly took inspiration from Leonardo da Vinci’s famous painting to create the setting,” an Olympics spokesperson admitted to The Post in a statement on Saturday, referring to the opening ceremony creative director.
“He is not the first artist to make a reference to what is a world-famous work of art. From Andy Warhol to ‘The Simpsons,’ many have done it before him,” the statement continued.

The stunning admission came after the Paris Olympics already tried to deny it was inspired by the iconic Christian mural, claiming on X on Friday that it was just a misunderstanding.
The reps insisted Jolly wasn’t parodying the world-famous artwork featuring Jesus and the 12 apostles — but actually paying homage to Greek mythology and the Feast of Dionysus.
But as the fallout continued to intensify, the spokesperson reached out to The Post with an “updated statement” Monday, featuring “explanations” from Jolly himself — and which notably made no mention of “The Last Supper” or da Vinci.
The convenient, newly offered explanation is that the segment “depicts a great paean feast in which the gods of Olympus take part.

Barton, 41, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (July 3) accused of conveying an indecent or offensive message between January 3 and 8 in connection with posts on social media site X.
He appeared in the dock wearing a dark checked suit and a navy shirt and tie and spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth to deputy senior district Judge Tan Ikram, as well as to elect for his case to be heard at the Crown court after entering a not guilty plea.
Mr Barton tweeted after Aluko and Lucy Ward were pundits for ITV for an FA Cup match between Crystal Palace and Everton on January 4, allegedly comparing them to serial killers Fred and Rose West. In a follow-up tweet he compared Aluko to Joseph Stalin and Pol Pot, prosecutor Joshua Sanderson-Kirk told the court.

Barton was told he must appear at Liverpool Crown Court on August 27. Judge Ikram said: ""Mr Barton, I am sending your case to the Crown court. You will appear at 9.30am on the 27th August. I am granting you conditional bail with one condition that you will not make any mention of Eni Aluko on any social media, and that is either directly or indirectly, or by inference.
""I am imposing that condition to ensure no further offences are created. Make sure you are there on time please. If you do not appear, a warrant may be issued. You are free to leave the court.""
Mr Barton nodded at the judge as he left the court room with his defence solicitor Richard Derby. Ms Aluko, who played for Chelsea and England, scored 33 international goals in 102 games before retiring in 2020 and establishing a broadcasting career.

Barton, 41, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court today charged with malicious communications between January 3 and 8.
He spoke to confirm his identity and deny the charge during the brief hearing.
Barton was bailed on the condition he does not make any mention of Eni Aluko on any social media.
He will next appear at Liverpool Crown Court on August 27.
The ex-Bristol manager previously slammed the charge on X, saying: ""I'm up next month for 'malicious communications' charge at Warrington Mag for Eni Aluko tweets.
""Crazy times we're living in. Haven't the Police got enough on their hands?
""British system is becoming a Banana Republic. Lawfare used against its own citizens for having a dissenting voice.""
Barton landed himself in hot water after launching into vile attacks against a string of female pundits in December.
This included Eni and Lucy, who at the time were working as pundits for ITV on the FA Cup clash between Crystal Palace and Everton.
Barton allegedly claimed Eni ""can't even kick a ball properly"", before adding: ""Your coverage of the game EFC last night, took it to a new low.
""Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward, the Fred and Rose West of football commentary.""
Laura Woods branded a 'queen' as Eni Aluko spots what ITV presenter did five minutes before going live at Euros
The former Man City star then accused Eni of being in the ""Joseph Stalin category"" for ""murdering hundreds of thousands of fans' ears"", it is said.
Eni bravely revealed she was seeking legal action after the barrage left her ""scared"".
She added: ""It’s really important to say that online abuse has a direct impact on your safety and how you feel and how safe you feel in real life. I’",https://www.thesun.ie/sport/13509327/joey-barton-court-charged-posts-eni-aluko/

The study found that an effective way to minimise the environmental footprint of leveraging Artificial Intelligence is by moving IT workloads from on-premises infrastructure to cloud data centres in India and around the globe.
Accenture estimates that AWS’s global infrastructure is up to 4.1 times more efficient than on-premises. For Indian organisations, the total potential carbon reduction opportunity for AI workloads optimised on AWS is up to 99% compared to on-premises data centres.
This is credited to AWS’s utilisation of more efficient hardware (32%), improvements in power and cooling efficiency (35%), and additional carbon-free energy procurement (31%).
Further optimising on AWS by leveraging purpose-built silicon can increase the total carbon reduction potential of AI workloads to up to 99% for Indian organisations that migrate to and optimise on AWS.
“Considering 85% of global IT spend by organisations remains on-premises, a carbon reduction of up to 99% for AI workloads optimised on AWS in India is a meaningful sustainability opportunity for Indian organisations, according to Jenna Leiner, Head of Environment Social Governance (ESG) and External Engagement, AWS Global.
“As India accelerates towards its US$1 trillion-dollar digital opportunity and encourages investments into digital infrastructure, sustainability innovations and minimising IT related carbon emissions will be critical in also helping India meet its net-zero emissions by 2070 goal.

On Wednesday night, IPL franchise owners came together at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai to plan for the next season. The big topic of discussion was the mega auctions, and it quickly turned into a heated debate.

Shah Rukh Khan, co-owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders, was notably vocal against the idea of a mega auction. Fresh off his team's impressive IPL win, Khan argued that keeping more of the current players was a better strategy. His team had just finished on top and claimed the title for the third time, having beaten the Sunrisers Hyderabad in both the playoffs and the final.
🚨 IPL Owners' Meeting Highlights🚨
- Heated debate on holding a mega auction.
- KKR's Shah Rukh Khan opposes it, advocating for major retention.
- Punjab Kings' Ness Wadia disagrees with high retention numbers.
- Decision on auction to determine retention rules.#IPL2025 pic.twitter.com/wXHeEq0sP9— Shivam. (@Shivamvp14) July 31, 2024
Khan’s views led to a lively discussion with Ness Wadia, co-owner of the Punjab Kings, who was not in favor of retaining a large number of players. The clash between Khan and Wadia highlighted the differing opinions on how teams should be built for the future. Khan found an ally in Kavya Maran of Sunrisers Hyderabad, who echoed the sentiment that building a strong team takes time and stability.
The Punjab Kings, on the other hand, had a rough season in 2024, finishing ninth with only five wins out of 14 matches. This stark contrast to KKR’s success only added fuel to the debate about team management.

Despite being... content: TL;DR: Recent mobile platforms introduced by Qualcomm have largely focused on the high-end segment of the smartphone market. The fabless chip manufacturer is now releasing another SoC specifically designed for more affordable devices, although the company still aims to market it with ""premium"" features, including AI.
Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 mobile chip aims to reshape how the world, or at least some parts of it, connects to the internet. Despite being designed for more affordable smartphones, the SoC provides all the necessary technology for enjoying entertainment and sharing content online, including all-day battery and a Gigabit 5G modem.
Qualcomm says its 5G Modem-RF System is optimized for balancing performance and efficiency. The modem supports sub-6 GHz 5G networks, with 2x2 MIMO antennas providing a maximum download speed of one gigabit per second. It also supports multimode connectivity for LTE, WCDMA, HSPA, and GSM/Edge legacy networks.
Qualcomm's latest is built on an efficient 4nm process node. The CPU includes two ""Kryo"" performance cores (up to 2 GHz) and six efficiency cores (1.6 GHz), which are slightly slower compared to the existing Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC. The Adreno GPU is designed to handle Full HD displays and deliver up to 90 frames per second, according to Qualcomm. Additionally, the camera supports up to 84 MP shots with a dual 12-bit image processor.
Qualcomm highlights that the chip includes AI-based echo cancellation technology for enhanced audio processing, with noise suppression algorithms designed to reduce background noise in busy environments. It also features improved navigation capabilities with dual-frequency navIC positioning and native support for mobile payment platforms. navIC is an autonomous satellite navigation system operated by India, which is likely a key market for Qualcomm's new chip.
The first confirmed partner for the Snapdragon 4s Gen 2 SoC is the Chinese brand Xiaomi. Despite facing challenges due to techn",https://www.techspot.com/news/104073-qualcomm-snapdragon-4s-gen-2-soc-designed-cheap.html

On Wednesday night, IPL franchise owners came together at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai to plan for the next season. The big topic of discussion was the mega auctions, and it quickly turned into a heated debate.
Shah Rukh Khan and Ness Wadia engaged in a heated debate during the IPL owners' meeting at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. The disagreement centered around the upcoming mega auction and retention policies. #IPL pic.twitter.com/ucp1IaEpB9— Infornex (@infornexmedia) August 1, 2024
Shah Rukh Khan, co-owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders, was notably vocal against the idea of a mega auction. Fresh off his team's impressive IPL win, Khan argued that keeping more of the current players was a better strategy. His team had just finished on top and claimed the title for the third time, having beaten the Sunrisers Hyderabad in both the playoffs and the final.
🚨 IPL Owners' Meeting Highlights🚨
- Heated debate on holding a mega auction.
- KKR's Shah Rukh Khan opposes it, advocating for major retention.
- Punjab Kings' Ness Wadia disagrees with high retention numbers.
- Decision on auction to determine retention rules.#IPL2025 pic.twitter.com/wXHeEq0sP9— Shivam. (@Shivamvp14) July 31, 2024
Khan’s views led to a lively discussion with Ness Wadia, co-owner of the Punjab Kings, who was not in favor of retaining a large number of players. The clash between Khan and Wadia highlighted the differing opinions on how teams should be built for the future. Khan found an ally in Kavya Maran of Sunrisers Hyderabad, who echoed the sentiment that building a strong team takes time and stability.
The Punjab Kings, on the other hand, had a rough season in 2024, finishing ninth with only five wins out of 14 matches. This stark contrast to KKR’s success only added fuel to the debate about team management.

TPG Telecom Ltd (ASX: TPG) shares are in the green on Monday and are currently trading 0.33% higher at $4.62 apiece.
While the company has not posted anything market-sensitive today, the increase comes amid media reporting that Vocus Group has rekindled its interest in acquiring TPG's fibre network.
TPG shares are down more than 11% this year to date, so this might have reignited investor interest on Monday. This is despite uncertainty surrounding the negotiations' outcome.
Let's take a look.
TPG shares in focus as Vocus reopens talks
Vocus Group is an international telecommunications company that's headquartered in Australia.
Last year, it proposed to acquire TPG's extensive fibre network for $6.3 billion. It would have encompassed the enterprise, government, and wholesale divisions along with its fixed infrastructure assets, including 27,000 kilometres of fibre.
Vocus Group is back in discussions with TPG after initially walking away from its initial proposal, The Australian Financial Review reports.
Talks fell through when both parties couldn't reach a deal.
But TPG shares have been down sharply since then, having slid more than 11% this year to date — at a time when broad markets demonstrated strength.
This latest round of discussions is reportedly in the early stages, and a deal is not guaranteed.
TPG also started a strategic review in October 2022. It has been ongoing since and has yet to yield a sale of its Vision Networks unit.
Vocus's renewed bid, if successful, could impact TPG's financial position with a multi-billion dollar cash injection. What TPG does with those funds next will be pivota",https://www.fool.com.au/2024/08/05/tpg-shares-surge-as-vocus-shifts-back-onto-the-menu/

On Wednesday, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) had a day to remember and stormed higher. The benchmark index rose 1.75% to 8,092.3 points.
Will the market be able to build on this on Thursday? Here are five things to watch:
ASX 200 expected to rise
The Australian share market looks set to rise again on Thursday following a very strong night on Wall Street. According to the latest SPI futures, the ASX 200 is expected to open the day 14 points or 0.15% higher this morning. In the United States, the Dow Jones was up 0.25%, the S&P 500 rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq raced 2.65% higher. This was driven by the US Federal Reserve confirming its intention to cut interest rates in September.
Oil prices jump
ASX 200 energy shares Beach Energy Ltd (ASX: BPT) and Woodside Energy Group Ltd (ASX: WDS) could have a good session after oil prices jumped overnight. According to Bloomberg, the WTI crude oil price is up 5% to US$78.40 a barrel and the Brent crude oil price is up 2.7% to US$80.72 a barrel. Middle East tensions were behind the rise.
Sell TPG shares
Goldman Sachs thinks TPG Telecom Ltd (ASX: TPG) shares are overvalued. This morning, the broker has downgraded the telco's shares to a sell rating with a $4.35 price target. It commented: ""We downgrade TPG to Sell (from Neutral) as our least preferred ANZ telco, given: (1) less absolute valuation support vs. SPK; (2) a more uncertain earnings outlook, given greater cost inflation; and (3) less balance sheet optionality. TPG does have upside risks, including: (1) potential M&A (i.e. Vocus bid in Aug-23, and Vision Network strategic review since Oct-22); and (2) execution on its transformation program.""

SILVER LAKE, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Police released an image of a man suspected of sexually assaulting a woman in a string of ""hot prowl"" burglaries in the Silver Lake and East Hollywood neighborhoods.
The burglaries happened early Saturday then again on Tuesday night. Police said in one of the incidents, a woman was sexually assaulted while she was sleeping in her bed.
The suspect is between 20 to 35 years old with a thin build, according to police. He was last seen wearing dark athletic pants, black shoes with a white logo, a dark sweatshirt or windbreaker and a dark hat.
The hot prowls - defined as a break-in when someone is home - have residents in the area concerned.
""This is my home, so naturally it makes me question the safety of my neighborhood,"" said local resident Kom Dwani who spoke with Eyewitness News. ""Overall I feel pretty safe. I walk around all the time. I walk around with my very large dog, so I feel comfortable. But when things like this are happening, it gives me a moment of pause, for sure.""
Police are reminding the public to take precautions at their homes, including locking all doors and windows, installing exterior lighting and keeping an eye out for suspicious people.",https://abc7.com/post/lapd-releases-new-image-suspect-string-hot-prowl-burglaries-silver-lake-east-hollywood/15133789/

Goldman Sachs has been busy running the rule over the small to mid-sized companies that it has under coverage ahead of earnings season.
Two buy-rated ASX shares that it believes will outperform expectations this month are listed below. Here's what it is predicting:
Life360 Inc (ASX: 360)
According to the note, Goldman Sachs is expecting this location technology company to outperform expectations later this week when it releases its second quarter update.
The broker is forecasting revenue of US$88.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$6.5 million for the three months. This is comfortably ahead of the consensus estimates of US$85.4 million and US$2 million, respectively.
Also expected to come in ahead of expectations are monthly active users at 69.6 million (cons. 67.4 million) and paying circles at 2.01 million (cons. 1.94 million).
Commenting on what else to look out for, Goldman said:
360 reports its 2Q result on Friday 9th August 2024. We will be focused on: (1) Subscription growth outlook through the back half of CY24 following strong subs momentum in 2Q24 (2mn paying subs announced in Jun-24), and the composition of subscription growth across the US and international; (2) Advertising outlook/guidance, including top line and margin expectations, and details on user base monetisation; and (3) Longer term margin framework, such as commentary regarding statutory EBITDA +ve in FY25E while reinvesting into longer-term growth initiatives.
The broker has a buy rating and $16.05 price target on its shares.

Goldman Sachs,8983,2024-08-05T01:56:44Z,"Asian Markets Take a Hit as Recession Fears Rise Description: Asian share markets tumbled and bonds rallied on Monday as investor concerns about a potential U.S. recession grew. Japan's Nikkei suffered major losses while U.S. and European futures also saw declines. Bond yields fell sharply, and analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan predict significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. content: Asian share markets tumbled and bonds rallied on Monday, driven by increasing fears of a looming U.S. recession. Investors fled from risk assets, wagering that interest rates will need to fall rapidly to sustain economic growth. The downturn in Asia began where markets left off on Friday, with Nasdaq futures down 2.27%, S&P 500 futures losing 1.41%, EUROSTOXX 50 futures declining 0.6%, and FTSE futures dropping 0.2%.
Japan's Nikkei experienced a staggering 5.5% drop, hitting seven-month lows and marking its biggest three-session loss since the 2011 financial crisis. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 2.0%. In contrast, Chinese blue chips saw a rare gain, rising 0.4%, supported by an increase in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.
Japanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply, plummeting 17 basis points to their lowest since April. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with 10-year yields reaching 3.723%, the lowest since mid-2023. Investors are now eyeing the Federal Reserve's next moves, with analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan predicting significant interest rate cuts by the end of the year.

Now could be the time to snap up NextDC Ltd (ASX: NXT) shares according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.
That's because its analysts believe that the ASX tech stock is currently trading at an ""unjustified"" discount to peers.
And that was before the data centre operator's shares crashed deep into the red on Monday, making its shares arguably even more attractive today.
What is Goldman saying about this ASX tech stock?
Goldman Sachs has been looking at recent quarterly updates and industry feedback and believes it is all favourable for NextDC's outlook. It commented:
Recent US quarterly results +ve for NXT: (1) At Jun-24 quarterly results, all 3 hyperscalers and META spoke to higher forward looking capex investment to support AI/cloud products, while AWS/Google are seeing an acceleration in CC rev. growth (Azure slowed marginally, but MSFT guided to Azure re-acceleration in C1H25); and (2) Global DC peer DLR reported strong pricing trends in the key North Virginia Market – which we view as a positive proxy for AU pricing trends (AU partly an 'overflow' market for US AI demand).
In respect to industry feedback, Goldman adds:
industry feedback also constructive, noting i) AU competition not as fierce as commonly believed, with all operators doing well; ii) NXT as largely locked-in contracts at its S3/S6/M2/M3 facilities, but these could take 2-3 months to finalize; (iii) NXT is now perceived as the #1 provider of Enterprise colo in AU.
Big returns
In response to the above, the broker has reiterated its buy rating and $19.00 price target on the ASX tech stock.
Based on its current share price of $15.67, this implies potential upside of 21% for investors from current levels.

Goldman Sachs has been busy running the rule over the small to mid-sized companies that it has under coverage ahead of earnings season.
Two buy-rated ASX shares that it believes will outperform expectations this month are listed below. Here's what it is predicting:
Life360 Inc (ASX: 360)
According to the note, Goldman Sachs is expecting this location technology company to outperform expectations later this week when it releases its second quarter update.
The broker is forecasting revenue of US$88.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$6.5 million for the three months. This is comfortably ahead of the consensus estimates of US$85.4 million and US$2 million, respectively.
Also expected to come in ahead of expectations are monthly active users at 69.6 million (cons. 67.4 million) and paying circles at 2.01 million (cons. 1.94 million).
Commenting on what else to look out for, Goldman said:
360 reports its 2Q result on Friday 9th August 2024. We will be focused on: (1) Subscription growth outlook through the back half of CY24 following strong subs momentum in 2Q24 (2mn paying subs announced in Jun-24), and the composition of subscription growth across the US and international; (2) Advertising outlook/guidance, including top line and margin expectations, and details on user base monetisation; and (3) Longer term margin framework, such as commentary regarding statutory EBITDA +ve in FY25E while reinvesting into longer-term growth initiatives.

Japan's Nikkei suffered major losses while U.S. and European futures also saw declines. Bond yields fell sharply, and analysts at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan predict significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. content: Asian share markets tumbled and bonds rallied on Monday, driven by increasing fears of a looming U.S. recession. Investors fled from risk assets, wagering that interest rates will need to fall rapidly to sustain economic growth. The downturn in Asia began where markets left off on Friday, with Nasdaq futures down 2.27%, S&P 500 futures losing 1.41%, EUROSTOXX 50 futures declining 0.6%, and FTSE futures dropping 0.2%.
Japan's Nikkei experienced a staggering 5.5% drop, hitting seven-month lows and marking its biggest three-session loss since the 2011 financial crisis. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 2.0%. In contrast, Chinese blue chips saw a rare gain, rising 0.4%, supported by an increase in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.
Japanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply, plummeting 17 basis points to their lowest since April. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with 10-year yields reaching 3.723%, the lowest since mid-2023. Investors are now eyeing the Federal Reserve's next moves, with analysts from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan predicting significant interest rate cuts by the end of the year.

Now could be the time to snap up NextDC Ltd (ASX: NXT) shares according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.
That's because its analysts believe that the ASX tech stock is currently trading at an ""unjustified"" discount to peers.
And that was before the data centre operator's shares crashed deep into the red on Monday, making its shares arguably even more attractive today.
What is Goldman saying about this ASX tech stock?
Goldman Sachs has been looking at recent quarterly updates and industry feedback and believes it is all favourable for NextDC's outlook. It commented:
Recent US quarterly results +ve for NXT: (1) At Jun-24 quarterly results, all 3 hyperscalers and META spoke to higher forward looking capex investment to support AI/cloud products, while AWS/Google are seeing an acceleration in CC rev. growth (Azure slowed marginally, but MSFT guided to Azure re-acceleration in C1H25); and (2) Global DC peer DLR reported strong pricing trends in the key North Virginia Market – which we view as a positive proxy for AU pricing trends (AU partly an 'overflow' market for US AI demand).
In respect to industry feedback, Goldman adds:
industry feedback also constructive, noting i) AU competition not as fierce as commonly believed, with all operators doing well; ii) NXT as largely locked-in contracts at its S3/S6/M2/M3 facilities, but these could take 2-3 months to finalize; (iii) NXT is now perceived as the #1 provider of Enterprise colo in AU.
Big returns
In response to the above, the broker has reiterated its buy rating and $19.00 price target on the ASX tech stock.
Based on its current share price of $15.67, this implies potential upside of 21% for investors from current levels.

Goldman Sachs has been busy running the rule over the small to mid-sized companies that it has under coverage ahead of earnings season.
Two buy-rated ASX shares that it believes will outperform expectations this month are listed below. Here's what it is predicting:
Life360 Inc (ASX: 360)
According to the note, Goldman Sachs is expecting this location technology company to outperform expectations later this week when it releases its second quarter update.
The broker is forecasting revenue of US$88.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of US$6.5 million for the three months. This is comfortably ahead of the consensus estimates of US$85.4 million and US$2 million, respectively.
Also expected to come in ahead of expectations are monthly active users at 69.6 million (cons. 67.4 million) and paying circles at 2.01 million (cons. 1.94 million).
Commenting on what else to look out for, Goldman said:
360 reports its 2Q result on Friday 9th August 2024. We will be focused on: (1) Subscription growth outlook through the back half of CY24 following strong subs momentum in 2Q24 (2mn paying subs announced in Jun-24), and the composition of subscription growth across the US and international; (2) Advertising outlook/guidance, including top line and margin expectations, and details on user base monetisation; and (3) Longer term margin framework, such as commentary regarding statutory EBITDA +ve in FY25E while reinvesting into longer-term growth initiatives.
The broker has a buy rating and $16.05 price target on its shares.

The campaign uses hijacked Facebook accounts to push the applications on social media using paid advertising to spread the malware.
The attackers trick Facebook pages into surrendering their credentials with phishing messages that take users to fake account protection pages which then steal their password.
Facebook malvertising
Jaromir Horejsi, a threat researcher for Trend Micro who analyzed the campaign, said “We discovered a malvertising campaign involving a threat actor that steals social media pages, changing their names to make them seem connected to popular AI photo editors. The threat actor then creates malicious posts with links to fake websites made to resemble the actual website of the legitimate photo editor. To increase traffic, the perpetrator then boosts the malicious posts via paid ads” (via BleepingComputer ).
The software package that the victims install is not the AI image editor, and is instead the Itarian remote desktop tool which then launches a downloader on the victims device that installs the Lumma Stealer malware. This malware covertly sniffs through the victims files in search of valuable data, such as cryptocurrency wallet files, credentials, password manager files, and browser data.

In response to the campaign, Horejsi provided some ways to stay safe from the campaign, stating, “Users should enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all social media accounts to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

In 2014, Rachael Makiri was the wife of Gareth Price.
Mr Price was best mates with David Simmons, who was the partner of Ms Wensley.

Ms Makiri was also a good friend of Ms Wensley and on the last day of her life, spent it with her and their children shopping and baking.
She was not there when the shot that killed Ms Wensley was fired.
In the hours after Ms Makiri found out the terrible news, she told police there had been no signs of problems — and there had never been any inkling of self-harm.
“Amy seemed fine and I didn’t notice anything was wrong,” she told them.

However, Ms Makiri’s husband later told police that his wife had remembered something else — Ms Wensley, out of the blue in the middle of a conversation that afternoon, had asked: “Have you ever thought about committing suicide?”
It prompted police to take another statement from her, in which she confirmed that Ms Wensley had asked the question.
It was question Coroner Sarah Linton later placed some significance on, despite it having first been raised by a second-hand source.
“I accept that Amy loved her daughters unconditionally but many people who love their family sadly do commit suicide in moments of despair, without thinking through the tragic consequences,” Ms Linton said.
In their investigations for Seven’s gripping podcast The Truth About Amy, journalists Liam Bartlett and Alison Sandy tracked down Ms Makiri to ask her about the out of character statement made by Ms Wensley.
“We made Mars Bar slice for the kids. We got the vegetables ready for the for dinner? And then the boys were late. So I went home. And that was it,” she said.

AI video creation platform Hedra raised $10 million in seed funding, continuing the demand for AI-focused investments and the interest in generative AI-powered creation products.
Hedra, founded by former Nvidia, Google, and Meta employees, has investors including Index Ventures, Abstract and A16Z Speedrun.
As part of its seed round, Hedra also released its video-focused foundation model Character-1 out of stealth. The company said Character-1, which it previewed to researchers in June, is “the fastest video foundation model on the market.
“Until now, creators faced tradeoffs for control and speed via generative video models,” the company said. “[In June], Character-1, our research preview, showed that this is no longer the case. The speed and ease of use are designed to turbocharge the efficiency of content creators and marketers.”
Hedra said more than 350,000 users have used the Character-1 platform and created over 1.6 million videos. The company said many of the videos made with Character-1 have gone viral on Reddit and Instagram. Hedra emphasized that it allows users to create AI popstars and AI-generated content. It also wants to continue improving its safety and content moderation features.
The company plans to focus on making its platform more multimodal so it can “integrate story, sound and video generation into one unified workflow.” Hedra hopes to streamline content creation to allow for the customization of digital avatars and characters using AI.
Hedra’s Character-1 is the latest video generation model to be released to the public in recent months. Haiper 1.5, which came out of stealth in March, said it could challenge OpenAI’s Sora. RunwayML, one of the pioneers of AI-generated videos, publicly launched its Gen-3 Alpha model in July, while Luma AI announced its realistic video platform Dream Machine in June.

The study found that an effective way to minimise the environmental footprint of leveraging Artificial Intelligence is by moving IT workloads from on-premises infrastructure to cloud data centres in India and around the globe.
Accenture estimates that AWS’s global infrastructure is up to 4.1 times more efficient than on-premises. For Indian organisations, the total potential carbon reduction opportunity for AI workloads optimised on AWS is up to 99% compared to on-premises data centres.
This is credited to AWS’s utilisation of more efficient hardware (32%), improvements in power and cooling efficiency (35%), and additional carbon-free energy procurement (31%).
Further optimising on AWS by leveraging purpose-built silicon can increase the total carbon reduction potential of AI workloads to up to 99% for Indian organisations that migrate to and optimise on AWS.

Acer's Aspire TC-1775-UR11 is a cheap pre-built desktop PC that will sell based on its price alone. Landing a Core i5-14400 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and lots of ports, often for around $440, is very hard to beat. It's easy to recommend to users who want a straightforward system that can handle tasks like streaming, web browsing, Office, and very light gaming. Just don't expect easy upgrades or high-quality hardware inside in the future.
Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .
I knew what I was getting into with Acer's Aspire TC-1775. These desktop PCs are all about affordability and ease of use, and though the design has changed slightly since I reviewed the predecessor, Aspire TC-895, in 2021, the core idea remains the same.
It's not a flashy PC, and it's not something you want to buy if you're interested in tinkering with the internals. Its price makes it accessible to many people who simply need a straightforward computer for home office work, student homework, streaming, and other light tasks. It's easy to set up, and it's happy to plug away day in and day out without much more than an occasional internal cleaning.
Yes, there are plenty of budget PCs on the market, but the fact that you can often find the Aspire TC-1775 for less than $450 with a discount — when the Core i5-14400 chip retails for about $235 on its own — is impressive.
I've been using the Acer Aspire TC-1775 for the past few weeks to uncover its quirks, test its performance, and ultimately help you decide if it's the right PC for your needs.

Intel Lunar Lake Ready For Launch Next Month: First Copilot+ Laptop Listed With Core Ultra 5 226V CPU For €1008 or $1100 US
Intel recently confirmed that its Lunar Lake ""Core Ultra 200V"" CPUs will be launching on the 3rd of September and will be the company's first Copilot+ laptops for clients. It looks like retailers around the globe have been briefed on the upcoming launch from Intel's OEM and partners and hence are listing the first laptops ahead of launch.
The first listing of the Intel Core Ultra 200V ""Lunar Lake"" CPU-powered laptops comes from Italian retailer, epto, which has the Acer Swift 14 AI ""SF14 51 58AA Copilot+"" PC listed on its store. The PC has been listed for €1008 or €1230 (including VAT). The non-VAT pricing equals $1100 US which is decent given that this is a preliminary price point that is expected to change when the actual launch occurs.
In terms of specifications, the Acer Swift 14 AI Copilot+ laptop is equipped with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V ""Lunar Lake"" CPU which is an entry-level chip with 8 cores and 8 threads, making use of a 4 P-Core and 4 LP-E core configuration based on Lion Cove P-Cores and Skymont LP-E cores. The chip houses 8 MB of cache (LLC), a base clock of 3.5 GHz, and a boost clock of 4.5 GHz, comes with Arc 130V iGPU based on the Xe2 architecture with a boost clock of up to 1.85 GHz, and features a PL1 TDP of 17W and a PL2 TDP of 30W. The chip is configured with 32 GB of LPDDR5X. The chip also features up to 40 NPU TOPS and 53 GPU TOPS for 93 accumulated AI TOPS.
The retail listing states that the Acer Swift 14 AI laptop is equipped with 16 GB of memory and comes with 512 GB of storage.

Take $150 off the Acer Chromebook 315 today when you purchase through Best Buy. content: Are you looking for the perfect back-to-school laptop? While we recommend having a look at some of the student laptop deals we found this week, we’d also like to draw your attention to this awesome Chromebook deal at Best Buy.
For a limited time, you’ll be able to purchase the Acer Chromebook 315 for only $199. At full price, this model usually sells for $350. We often see Acer gear on sale, but these types of sales are usually scooped up pretty quickly, especially when you consider that Acer already makes some of the most affordable laptops on the market.
Why you should buy the Acer Chromebook 315
The Chromebook 315 isn’t the most powerful computer on the market, but that’s because its target demographic is more casual users and students. Running on an Intel Pentium CPU with 4GB of RAM and integrated Intel UHD Graphics, the 315 is perfect for browsing the web, taking notes, and watching HD movies and TV shows.
With 128GB of internal storage to play with, you’ll have plenty of bytes to store important documents, photos, videos, and other file types. In the event you’d like to add more storage, you can connect a USB flash drive or external hard drive to one of the Chromebook 315’s USB-C or USB-A ports. There’s even an SD card slot if you’d prefer storing media that way. Not to mention the headphone jack if you plan on connecting a set of wired headphones, though the Chromebook 315 does support Bluetooth connectivity too.
On a full charge, you can expect up to 10 hours of battery life, which is plenty of power to get you through a day full of classes and other on-the-go applications. Acer was also kind enough to provide a canvas carrying sleeve.
Best Buy deals will often last the entire week, but that’s not a guarantee. So if you’d like to beat some of the back-to-school crowds, we’d recommend grabbing this Acer now.

Experts have long suspected it, but a new study confirms that folks who vape and smoke tobacco face higher risks for lung cancer than if they'd done either alone. ""From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about dual-use of both traditional and e-cig products,"" said study lead author Marisa Bittoni, an oncology researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus. Advertisement
""This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer,"" said Bittoni, who works at the university's Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute.
Her team tracked rates of both vaping and smoking among nearly 5,000 Columbus-area people diagnosed with lung cancer, and compared them to a group of almost 27,300 people without cancer.
The results: Folks who had both smoked and vaped were eight times more likely to be in the lung cancer group than the group that was cancer-free.
Moreover, people who both vaped and smoked were four times more likely to go on to develop lung cancer compared to people who had only smoked, Bittoni's group found.
The findings were published recently in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy.

""Our findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone,"" said study co-author Dr. Randall Harris, a professor of epidemiology in the university's College of Public Health.
""Most people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals but, overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals that are inhaled through vape vapors,"" he added.

Fish oil supplements might help high-risk seniors stave off Alzheimer's disease, a new study finds. Older people with a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's experienced slower breakdown of their brain's nerve cells if they took fish oil capsules, researchers reported Thursday in the journal JAMA Network Open.

These people carry the APOE4 gene variant, which increases risk of Alzheimer's and is associated with an earlier age of onset, according to the National Institute on Aging.
""The fact that neuronal integrity breakdown was slowed in people randomized to omega-3 treatment who are also at high risk for Alzheimer's disease is remarkable, and warrants a larger clinical trial in more diverse populations in the future,"" said researcher Gene Bowman, a neurology instructor with the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
However, fish oil supplements did not benefit all seniors in general, researchers noted.
""Our findings showed that over three years, there was not a statistically significant difference between placebo and the group that took fish oil,"" said researcher Dr. Lynne Shinto, a professor of neurology with the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine.

Adobe had originally allowed Premiere Pro to run when Copilot+ PCs first launched but disabled the ability once it became aware of performance issues and glitches.
The app is now back in the Creative Cloud app, suggesting Adobe has solved some of those early problems. The app still runs under emulation, meaning it will run slower compared to an Intel or AMD machine. In our early testing, the app is good enough for a basic video project with a handful of layers and audio at 1080p.

The company does say it is working on an ARM-native version of Premiere Pro, but unfortunately, it doesn't say when the ARM-native version of Premiere Pro will be ready. Photoshop is already natively available on Windows on ARM. Other Adobe apps such as After Effects are expected to come to Windows on ARM under emulation later this year.
Snapdragon X-powered Copilot+ PCs first launched on June 18, after a big unveiling event held the month prior. During that event, Adobe committed to supporting Windows on ARM with the Adobe Creative Suite, and you can already run Photoshop, Fresco, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Acrobat, Firefly, and Illustrator (beta) on the new Snapdragon X laptops.
Adobe's competitors are also working to bring their apps to the Windows on ARM platform. Apps such as the video and color editing suite DaVinci Resolve already has a beta build available that's native to Windows on ARM.

As the next generation becomes increasingly exposed to artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in their everyday lives, students and educators have been turning to AI tools to strengthen learning in the classroom. Despite initial rejection from educational institutions about using the technology in some capacity, most educators are now in favor -- and Adobe is taking note.
Last week, the company revealed new features in Adobe Express for Education, a platform designed to be a responsible and classroom-safe AI tool that encourages students to take charge of their learning experience.
Also: Meet Gemini Education: Three ways Google is equipping students and educators with AI
Built by and for educators, Adobe Express for Education leverages Adobe Express technology to let students engage in creative projects and assignments while being ""collaborative, easy, and improv[ing] student engagement and communication."" This includes a first-of-its-kind Assignments feature that connects teachers and students in real-time, enhanced multimedia presentations and animation capabilities, and thousands of readily available subject-specific templates.
""For today's K-12 educators, it's critical that we integrate AI into our classroom curriculum, but simply having access to AI tools isn't enough,"" said Christine Morgan, a teacher at Cypress-Fairbanks ISD at Hairgrove Elementary. Adobe hopes its emphasis on generative AI (gen AI) features will help bolster creative potential and equalize the playing field in the classroom so all students can ""unleash"" their artistic talents and critical thinking skills.
Also: Apple now offers AI training for thousands of students and alumni
One of Adobe Express for Education's most defining features is its accessibility -- the platform is free to use for all K-12 teachers and students. Adobe Express for Education can also be integrated with existing education software, including Canvas, Google Classroom, Schoology, and more.

It’s also the most expensive at $799, but right now, you can pick it up at Amazon with an Ocean Band, an Alpine Loop, or a Trail Loop for $699.99 ($99 off). That’s not its lowest price to date — we’ve seen it fall to $642 in select configurations before — but the Ocean Band model rarely dips below $719, unlike the others.
Powered by Apple’s S9 SiP processor and second-gen ultra wideband chip, the Apple Ultra 2 allows for onboard Siri processing and Apple’s new double tap feature, which lets you control the watch by tapping your index fingers and thumb together twice.

Experts argue that addressing degradation is equally crucial for climate goals. content: Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva began his term in 2023 with a pledge to combat Amazon deforestation and reclaim his country's leadership in climate action.

However, a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences indicates that deforestation is just a part of the problem. Using advanced airborne laser scanning, researchers found that human-induced degradation and natural disturbances release far more carbon dioxide than clear-cut deforestation, accounting for 83% of emissions.
The research highlights that despite forests' natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide, the Amazon is currently emitting more carbon than it absorbs due to ongoing degradation. The study's lead author, Ovidiu Csillik of Wake Forest University, stated the findings offer unprecedented insights into forest degradation. Scientists argue that focusing solely on deforestation overlooks other critical climate impacts.

This judgment sets a precedent for potential regulatory actions against other tech giants like Apple, Meta, and Amazon. Each company is facing multiple lawsuits globally, targeting various monopolistic and privacy-infringing practices. content: The U.S. antitrust authorities have secured a significant win as a federal judge ruled that Alphabet's Google maintained an illegal monopoly on online search. This verdict marks a major milestone in a series of lawsuits challenging the dominance of Big Tech companies.
The ruling against Google lays the groundwork for a subsequent trial, which could lead to remedies including a potential breakup of Alphabet. This development is poised to dramatically alter the online advertising landscape, where Google has maintained a stronghold for years.
Besides Google, other Big Tech players like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Amazon are also under intense regulatory scrutiny. Apple faces ongoing lawsuits for monopolizing the smartphone market and is being scrutinized under Europe's new Digital Markets Act.

Apple,8983,2024-08-05T22:10:48Z,"‘You are a helpful mail assistant,’ and other Apple Intelligence instructions Description: Here are ome of the prompts that Apple Intelligence is using to guide AI models in thje macOS 15.1 Sequoia developer beta. content: Apple’s latest developer betas launched last week with a handful of the generative AI features that were announced at WWDC and are headed to your iPhones, iPads, and Macs over the next several months. On Apple’s computers however, you can actually read the instructions programmed into the model supporting some of those Apple Intelligence features.
They show up as prompts that precede anything you say to a chatbot by default, and we’ve seen them uncovered for AI tools like Microsoft Bing and DALL-E before. Now a member of the macOS 15.1 beta subreddit posted that they’d discovered the files containing those backend prompts. You can’t alter any of the files, but they do give an early hint at how the sausage is made.
In the example above, an AI bot for a “helpful mail assistant” is being told how to ask a series of questions based on the content of an email. It could be part of Apple’s Smart Reply feature, which can go on to suggest possible replies for you.

This sounds like Apple’s “Rewrite” feature, one of the Writing Tools that you can access by highlighting text and right-clicking (or, in iOS, long-pressing) on it. Its instructions include passages saying “Please limit the answer within 50 words. Do not hallucinate. Do not make up factual information.”

This brief prompt summarizes emails, with a careful instruction not to answer any questions.

I’m pretty certain that this is ajax’s instruction set for generating a “Memories” video with Apple Photos. The passage that says ”do not write a story that is religious, political, harmful, violent, sexual, filthy or in any way negative, sad or provocative” might just explain why the feature rejected my prompt asking for “images of sadness”:

ASUS ROG Ally X Gaming Handheld: $799.99 at Best Buy
The second gaming handheld from ASUS refines the machine significantly, fixing many issues users had with the original model and improving performance dramatically.
Impressive Gaming Performance
Great Software Compatibility
Fantastic Battery Life
Outdoor-Usable Freesync Display
Solid External Connectivity
Drivers Only Available Through ASUS
Rather Heavy For Long Play Sessions
Very Pricey
The ASUS ROG Ally X is on the test bench today, so let's see how this second coming of ASUS' handheld gaming PC stacks up.
The original ASUS ROG Ally gaming handheld was decidedly a ""1.0"" revision device, in our opinion. It offered surprisingly-potent handheld gaming performance with a first-to-market 120Hz Freesync IPS LCD. It also had its share of problems though, which included reported SD card reader failures and problems with triggers on early systems. Even still, we liked the ASUS Ally quite a bit, and in our original review , we really put it through its paces. We tested over 66 games on the Ally, in addition to our usual suite of productivity and office benchmarks. Now that ASUS has shipped its successor to the Ally, or perhaps the ""version 1.5"" revision known as the ROG Ally X, we're here to provide you the same diligent, deep evaluation.The ASUS ROG Ally X is on the test bench today, so let's see how this second coming of ASUS' handheld gaming PC stacks up.

SteamOS software provides a console-like experience, while ROG Ally X still runs Windows, which is lousy for handhelds.
Steam Deck's fast suspend/resume feature allows for seamless gameplay, a unique advantage over other handheld devices.
Asus took our wishlist for the Asus ROG Ally 2 and turned it into a reality by way of the ROG Ally X. It's true that the new ROG Ally X isn't a direct ROG Ally successor, namely because it uses the same AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chipset. However, the company fixed just about everything we hated about the original handheld, adding double the battery capacity, a second USB-C port, more memory, and better ergonomics. I've loved my time with the ROG Ally X, but I also recently bought a Steam Deck. There are a few key ways that Valve's gaming handheld blows Asus' offering out of the water.
I have the LCD version of the Steam Deck, so the OLED screen isn't one of the reasons I enjoy using the handheld more than the ROG Ally X at times. That's fine, because the display battle between the Steam Deck OLED and the ROG Ally X is a complete toss-up. Sure, the Steam Deck has an OLED panel, but it also has a lower resolution than the ROG Ally X, and lacks variable refresh rate support on the inbuilt screen. Neither option trounces the other in terms of display quality; it's simply a question of what matters more: OLED or resolution and VRR?
Related Steam Deck OLED review: More than just a screen upgrade The Steam Deck OLED dropped by surprise recently, and it's a fantastic handheld that's more than just a screen upgrade.
Instead, there are three small Steam Deck characteristics that make the gaming handheld experience so much more enjoyable. Consider these points before you go out and buy a new ROG Ally X, because they might sway you.

ZDNET's key takeaways
The Canon Powershot V10
Its ultra-portable form factor is great for live streaming or video conferences.
However, it's a ""video first"" camera, as the photos it produces are not much to talk about.
The Canon Powershot V10 burst on the the scene last year as Canon's attempt to reach vloggers who were ready to ditch their smartphones -- but wanted a budget-friendly alternative. This camera is different from a typical point-and-shoot with its branding as a video-first device: Canon wants the creator to know that video is king.
Also: The camera I recommend to most new photographers is not a Sony or Nikon (and it's $100 off)
So what is the Powershot V10? On first glance it looks a bit like a chunkier version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip smartphone with its foldable form factor. It has a one-inch CMOS sensor like a point and shoot camera, but it also touts a Digic X processor.
This is the same processor found in many of the high-end camera bodies such as the R5. Why so much processing capability in this little point and shoot?
View at Amazon
The Powershot V10 gets a processing boost in its image sensor because of the video capability. It shoots 4K at 30 frames per second and 1080p at 60 frames per second. If you scoffed at that frame rate, know there's more to that spec.
Yes, it's a slower 4K frame rate than your smartphone, but due to the processor, you'll get better auto focus performance since the V10 locks onto faces with ease within the 19mm (wide) framing. It is impressive to see the auto focus lock and track subjects in a small camera you'd assume has limited computing power.
4K 30 in the VR10 menus Ant Pruitt
The digital image stabilization feature is pretty smooth, but there's a caveat. When stabilization is activated, your video is cropped in about 15% closer. You'll have to make adjustments for this in your framing if you're holding the camera in selfie mode, as you'll lose headroom in your shot.

Following the double launch of the EOS R1 and EOS R5 Mark II in July, there are now suggestions that it has a third full-frame mirrorless camera on the cards this year, the EOS R6 Mark III.
Speculation has been shared on Canon Rumors that the latest mid-range model with full-frame sensor could even hit the shelves at the very end of 2024, along with a list of expected specifications.
We must point out that the camera, announcement dates and specs are all based on rumors, though the timeline would tally with Canon's two-year cycle for the EOS R6 series so far, following the EOS R6 of 2020 and the EOS R6 Mark II that was launched at the end of 2022.
For a camera at this level, a two-year product cycle feels shorter than most, but with Nikon recently announced the excellent Z6 III that, in many ways, outguns the EOS R6 Mark II, Canon might not be able to afford to sit on this one.

The compelling Canon Nikon rivalry is set to continue
Canon Rumors says its sources have told them the EOS R6 Mark III is “pretty much ready to go”, along with a list of expected specs.
Apparently the sensor will once again be a 24MP one, but that it is 'related' to the stacked EOS R3 sensor, which is a much pricier and former flagship used by pro sports and wildlife photographers. There's no mention of burst shooting speeds, though we'd expect them to be faster if the stacked sensor rumor is true, plus there to be a better handle on rolling shutter distortion.
The Nikon Z6 III was the first camera of its kind to feature a 'partially' stacked sensor that has a faster readout speed than the Canon EOS R6 II's, and so an even quicker stacked sensor in a potential EOS R6 Mark III would be an obvious way for Canon to strike back.

Summary House of the Dragon confirms Brynden Rivers as the Three-Eyed Raven.
Brynden Rivers, or Bloodraven, was one of the Great Bastards of King Aegon IV Targaryen, and was born around 45 years after the Dance of the Dragons.
Bloodraven has been theorized to be the Three-Eyed Raven, or Crow, at least since A Dance with Dragons.
House of the Dragon's season 2 finale reveals the identity of the Three-Eyed Raven to be Brynden Rivers, confirming a theory that first stemmed from George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire books. The Three-Eyed Raven - or Three-Eyed Crow, in the books - is one of the most mysterious and powerful characters in Game of Thrones. While he helps Bran Stark learn to use his greensight and, eventually, is replaced by him, little is ever revealed about his origin.
It's said that he's 1,000 years old, and that there have been many Three-Eyed Ravens, but the show, unfortunately, didn't get into many specifics about his origins, or powers. One of the flaws with Game of Thrones' ending is so little was understood about Bran before he became king, and knowing more about the Three-Eyed Raven could have helped mitigate those issues. Its prequel isn't exactly fixing that but, if nothing else, House of the Dragon season 2's ending does at least confirm, via clear clues if not outright saying it, the man who became the Three-Eyed Raven before Bran.
House Of The Dragon Revealed The Three-Eyed Raven Is Brynden Rivers
Brynden Was A Targaryen Bastard, Known As Bloodraven
In the House of the Dragon season 2 finale, Daemon Targaryen has a vision that includes Daenerys, a White Walker, his own death, and Rhaenyra on the Iron Throne. Before all of those, however, he first sees a man sitting almost as part of the weirwood tree. His name isn't spoken, but he clearly looks like a Targaryen. The way he's joined with the tree is the first hint that this is the Three-Eyed Raven, and the raven t",https://screenrant.com/three-eyed-raven-bloodraven-identity-explained-game-of-thrones/
Canon,8981,2024-08-03T15:00:09Z,"I tested Canon's ingenious eye-control AF, and it made me feel at one with the camera Description: With a little refining, this feature could be a reason to switch to Canon content: I’ll always remember experiencing Canon’s ingenious Eye-control AF for the first time. It blew me away during a hands-on session with the Canon EOS R1 and Canon EOS R5 Mark II – Canon's latest mirrorless cameras for pros.
The autofocus feature is unique to Canon. Once you've calibrated it to your eye, you simply look through the viewfinder, and Eye-control AF selects the autofocus point based on where you're looking in the frame (the EOS R5 Mark II promo video below illustrates the feature, starting at 1:51).
Trust me: if you're a keen sports, wildlife or even portrait photographer and haven't experienced Eye-control AF yet, you should give it a go – it's very, very cool.
Both cameras have inherited Eye-control AF from the Canon EOS R3, and Canon says it's doubly effective in the latest models. However, while the tech actually dates all the way back to the Canon EOS 5, a SLR camera from the 1992, and remains unique to Canon cameras, Eye-control AF is still only found in a few Canon models decades later, while other leading manufacturers have left it completely alone, so what gives?
Well, there are limits to its use which could be one reason why (the 1992 version of the tech met with a mixed reception from photographers, and Canon didn't adopt it more widely), but it certainly is special, and for very important reasons.

Autofocus and the user disconnect
The world's best autofocus systems are peculiar, intelligent entities. In 2024, leading cameras such as the Sony A7R V are equipped with AI-autofocus and an array of subject-detection AF modes. We photographers can choose subject-specific tracking autofocus, sport-specific modes, eye-detection autofocus, or spot autofocus from anyone one of hundreds of autofocus points. The list goes on, and autofocus can get pretty complicated, pretty fast.

It’s a good question that comes up often and increasingly urgently as writers learn to fear the consequences of publishing stories about lives they haven’t lived. It’s become controversial to make money by recounting suffering if you have not yourself endured the suffering, as if readers are rewarding writers’ pain rather than purchasing their own reading pleasure.
Naturally I am sceptical about the principle here, I hope only partly because it is my vocation and my livelihood to imagine and recount experiences I have not had. I would defend everyone’s right and indeed obligation to try to see the world through others’ eyes whether we make art or not. Understanding that other people inhabit other norms and realities strikes me as a fairly basic part of human being, and fundamental to our ability to live together. If we say that acts of imagination are politically unacceptable, that no one may presume to understand any experience but their own, we isolate ourselves and each other, allege that others’ suffering is simply alien and incomprehensible. In times of great trouble, I have felt loneliest when well-meaning acquaintances said: “I can’t imagine what you’re going through.” You can, I wanted to say. You don’t want to. It’s exactly the way you’d imagine it.
Empathy is an act of imagination. So is mercy. Sometimes you have to work backwards from behaviour that seems unnatural or unreasonable: how would it have been in your head to reach a point where it seemed that violence towards yourself or another person was the best or only option? Sometimes people say that suicide and self-harm are despicable, selfish acts, but they are acts performed by people to whom it is self-evident that their own pain and death are to others’ benefit, just and right.

Description: Shares of Celestica (TSX:CLS) stock popped by up to 8% this week on news that the United States might be adding more restrictions on China. content: Shares of Celestica (TSX:CLS) stock popped by up to 8% this week on news that the United States might be adding more restrictions on China.
It wasn’t just earnings that caused shares of Celestica (TSX:CLS) to surge this week. The tech stock certainly saw a huge climb on strong results, but the company also received some great news on a global scale.
So, let’s get into why this could mean the stock is now an absurdly great deal.
What happened?
There were two catalysts that caused Celestica stock to climb this week. First, the company reported stellar earnings that beat out estimates last week. The company reported revenue at $2.39 billion, which was a 23% increase year over year. Furthermore, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up 65%, hitting $0.91.
The company’s outlook was also strong, with Celestica stock management aiming for $9.45 billion in revenue. And overall analysts were fairly positive with the company’s results.
In particular, analysts were pleased with Celestica stock’s connectivity and cloud solutions (CCS) segment, which saw a 51% increase in revenue. However, there was work to be done in the advanced technology solutions (ATS) segment, which saw an 11% drop.
Yet this was last week. So, what happened this week to cause another surge?
Trade wars
The recent surge in share price also came down to some news in the semiconductor world. Shares of companies in the semiconductor industry surged on reports that the United States would exclude allies now that are working with China on chip exports.
The news stated that allies such as Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea would all be excluded. This exemption contrasts with earlier reports indicating broader restrictions. The news sent North American stocks surging.
While the potential exclusion highlights ongoing tensions in the U.S.-China technology trade war, impacting global semiconductor supply chains, it was good news for those companies that would see their use likely climb as a result.

GIB-A-T is offering its first ever dividend, making it one of only a handful of Canada’s largest tech firms to distribute the profit-sharing payments to its investors.
The Montreal-based consulting company announced Tuesday it would start paying a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share in the first quarter of 2025, alongside the news that it had recorded net earnings of $440.1-million in its third quarter. Its revenue for the quarter totalled $3.67-billion, up $50-million from the year prior. These earnings translate to $1.94 per basic share, up 16 cents from last year.
CGI, Canada’s third most valuable publicly traded technology company, becomes only the fourth among the 10 largest technology names traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange to pay a dividend, joining Constellation Software Inc. CSU-T, Enghouse Systems Ltd. ENGH-T and Open Text Corp. OTEX-T.
By contrast, all of the largest players in many other TSX sectors pay out dividends, including financials, real estate, utilities and telecom services.
CGI’s offering will be the smallest of the four quarterly tech dividends, as Open Text pays 25 US cents a share with a 3.181 per cent annual dividend yield, Constellation pays US$1.00 with a 0.129 per cent yield and Enghouse pays 26 cents with a 3.453 per cent yield.
Thanos Moschopoulos, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said a dividend makes sense for mature companies such as CGI.
“It’s a company that many investors felt should be paying a dividend given their strong and consistent cash flow generation, the underlying diversification of the business, the balance sheet and I think investors have conveyed that feedback to management over the years,” he said.
Mr. Moschopoulos said Canada doesn’t see a lot of dividend-paying tech stocks because few are large or mature enough to support regular cash disbursements to shareholders.

The report from the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium, led by Cisco and counting the likes of SAP, Microsoft and IBM among its members, notes software development and business management positions, which are expected to have 61% and 48% evolution rates respectively, could be especially affected by the changes.
It added foundational skills are needed in response to the rise of new technologies, such as AI literacy, prompt engineering, and data analytics, and has suggested a rise in relevance for skills such as AI ethics, LLM architecture, and agile methodologies will push more traditional roles to the side.
Employer commitments
In response to the rapidly changing digital landscape, many companies have committed to training workers in the basics of ICT skills. Lisa Gevelber, Founder of Grow with Google confirms,
‘The benefits of AI must be accessible to every worker. We're proud to support the Consortium's new research, which will advance our shared vision to equip all workers with the AI skills they need to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow.’
Cisco itself has pledged to train 25 million people with cybersecurity and digital skills by 2032. Both Intel and IBM have committed to helping 30 million people with AI skills and digital skills respectively by 2030.
Google has also announced over $130 million in funding to support AI training and skills for workers across the US, Europe, Africa, Latin America and APAC.

Three employers—HepcoMotion, Dormakaba, and Heathcoats—teamed up with Elmore AFC to host a charity football match that raised £1,063.07 for Hospiscare.
The event, held at Elmore’s grounds, featured 11-a-side teams and 15-minute games, promoting both teamwork and community spirit.
Organised by Dormakaba, Ryan Perry said: ""To organise an event enjoyed by everyone who took part on behalf of such a wonderful charity is an honour. The work the hospice does is incredible, caring for people desperately in need and completely funded by donations. I'm glad the amazing community of businesses and the people of Tiverton could contribute and do our bit.""
HepcoMotion’s Paul Mallinson added: “As one of the largest employers in Tiverton, we were pleased to join forces with other local employers. The funds raised will make a significant difference to the hospice, helping them continue their vital work in our community.”
Lauren Butt, representative of Hospiscare, said: “We would like to extend a huge thank you to Dormakaba, HepcoMotion, Heathcoats, and Elmore AFC for uniting for an incredible day of fundraising. Your support is crucial to our efforts, and we have never needed your help as much as we do right now. This contribution will go a long way in supporting our patients and their families.”

In 2014, Rachael Makiri was the wife of Gareth Price.
Mr Price was best mates with David Simmons, who was the partner of Ms Wensley.

Ms Makiri was also a good friend of Ms Wensley and on the last day of her life, spent it with her and their children shopping and baking.
She was not there when the shot that killed Ms Wensley was fired.
In the hours after Ms Makiri found out the terrible news, she told police there had been no signs of problems — and there had never been any inkling of self-harm.
“Amy seemed fine and I didn’t notice anything was wrong,” she told them.

However, Ms Makiri’s husband later told police that his wife had remembered something else — Ms Wensley, out of the blue in the middle of a conversation that afternoon, had asked: “Have you ever thought about committing suicide?”
It prompted police to take another statement from her, in which she confirmed that Ms Wensley had asked the question.
It was question Coroner Sarah Linton later placed some significance on, despite it having first been raised by a second-hand source.
“I accept that Amy loved her daughters unconditionally but many people who love their family sadly do commit suicide in moments of despair, without thinking through the tragic consequences,” Ms Linton said.
In their investigations for Seven’s gripping podcast The Truth About Amy, journalists Liam Bartlett and Alison Sandy tracked down Ms Makiri to ask her about the out of character statement made by Ms Wensley.
“We made Mars Bar slice for the kids. We got the vegetables ready for the for dinner? And then the boys were late. So I went home. And that was it,” she said.

The print quality is up to the usual Instax standards, and it's great for those who like capturing wider shots; I found it wasn't the best for portrait shots and selfies, although the new macro lens attachment does improve this. Overall, if you can get past the dull green aesthetic and can dare to be seen with it in public, then it's a winner.

Fujifilm Instax Wide 400: One-minute review
The Fujifilm Instax Wide 400 is one of the best instant cameras for casual photographers who like the appeal of wider prints. It's ideal for landscape photographers and camping trips especially, with the wider format able to capture much more in the frame than other popular Instax Mini cameras, although be prepared to compromise when it comes to portraits.
Unlike other Instax cameras the Wide 400 doesn't have a built-in selfie mirror, and instead comes with a fiddly mirror attachment that doubles up as a macro lens. This can be clipped onto the Wide 400's lens when you want to take a selfie or portrait of a subject, or anything that's roughly 40-50cm away from the end of the lens.
(Image credit: Beth Nicholls)
During testing, I found the focusing process takes a bit of getting used to, but once you grasp it, and with the help of the enhanced viewfinder and target marker, it can capture pretty sharp shots. The biggest pain points with the Instax Wide 400 are the design and lack of features. Not much has been tweaked from the Wide 300 model other than the addition of the self-timer (which is admittedly very handy) and ",https://www.techradar.com/cameras/instant-cameras/fujifilm-instax-wide-400-review

1 minute
(Reuters) – The EU Commission on Thursday said it had unconditionally approved the $14 billion takeover of networking gear maker Juniper Networks by Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
The commission said its investigation had shown the deal would not significantly reduce competition in the markets for wireless local area network equipment and access points, ethernet campus switches and datacentre switches.
It said the merged company’s market position would remain moderate, while it would continue to face competition from a wide range of competitors.
People familiar with the matter on Monday already said HPE was set to secure approval for the deal announced in January.

Description: The 1973 Pontiac Grand Prix fits in a couple of different categories, so is it a muscle car or not? Let's take a look at it's horsepower figures to decide. content: We already mentioned that the 1973 Grand Prix isn't found on many lists of the best muscle cars, and this is likely because the Grand Prix has been considered more of a luxury car than a muscle car at various points in its history.
The Grand Prix was created and designed to combine the best aspects of luxury, performance, and unique style. Pontiac intended for the vehicle to rise above the mainstream vehicles of the day and tap into an older audience attracted to both extravagance and raw power. Ultimately, the automaker wanted to design a vehicle capable of competing with popular higher-end choices of the time, including models like the Buick Riviera. However, in reality and at its powerful V8 core, the Grand Prix is a muscle car — albeit one with a certain luxurious flare.
While the Grand Prix was initially designed to bridge the gap between luxury and American muscle, it has gone down in history for its position as an outlier in the world of more famous muscle cars like the Mustang and Camaro. It may not make most lists of the best muscle cars, but it holds a special place in automotive history as one of the most underappreciated Pontiac muscle cars of all time.",https://www.slashgear.com/1635600/1973-pontiac-grand-prix-how-much-horsepower-have-considered-muscle-car/

Why you should buy the HP Envy 2-in-1 laptop
HP is one of the best laptop brands around, and its particular prolific is when it comes to producing great 2-in-1 laptops. With the HP Envy 2-in-1 you get some great hardware. It has an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB of memory, and 1TB of SSD storage. At this price, we’d normally expect 512GB of SSD storage, so double is appealing here.
Of course, the highlight is the 16-inch touchscreen. The WUXGA IPS display offers better color accuracy and wider viewing angles than many other screens, and there’s a great resolution of 1920 x 1200. It’s a touchscreen too for those times when you want to be more hands-on such, as when you’ve switched the HP Envy into presentation or tablet mode. It’s competing with the best 2-in-1 laptops, but it doesn’t quite make the list.
The HP Envy also has plenty of other useful extras. These include HP Fast Charge so you can get from 0% to 50% battery life in just 45 minutes, and there’s a 5MP IR camera for great quality video calls. The camera has a privacy shutter for when you want to guarantee privacy. Thunderbolt 4 with USB Type-C support means you can connect up to two 4K displays with a single cable.
Even the sound is a cut above the rest thanks to Poly Studio Audio with dual speakers and HP Audio Boost. Other features include a backlit keyboard and a microphone mute button, and the laptop automatically detects when it’s placed in a bag so it knows to hibernate. It’s sure to be one of the best laptops for many students.

HP,8983,2024-08-05T14:45:41Z,"How Much HP Does A Cam Upgrade Add To A 5.7 HEMI? Description: There are many ways to increase the horsepower of a 5.7L HEMI, but one of the simpler ways is a cam upgrade. Here’s what to expect from a cam upgrade. content: Chrysler's third-generation HEMI engine debuted in 2003, continuing a tradition that extended back to the early 1950s. HEMI engines are named for the hemispherical shape of their chambers, which allows for more efficient combustion and bigger valves. The earliest third-gen HEMI displaced 5.7 liters and was used in '03 Ram trucks. It had state-of-the-art spark advance and fuel injection systems that made it more efficient than its predecessor, and a 2009 upgrade added variable valve timing (VVT) and displacement along with a redesigned intake manifold and cylinder heads. In the 2024 Ram 1500, the optional 5.7-liter HEMI puts out 395 horsepower, while the 2024 Charger's HEMI is good for 370 horses.

There are several routes you can take if you want to increase the output of your HEMI engine, but replacing the stock mild cam with a hotter upgraded version is a simple way to add some horses to your HEMI. But just how much horsepower can you get from a cam upgrade to this engine, and how much will it cost in terms of time and money?

IBM,8980,2024-08-02T18:30:00Z,"What turned IBM from tech titan to cautionary tale Description: Having birthed the personal computer in 1981, the company refused to put its might behind it and used chips and operating system software from two small companies – Intel and Microsoft. It never recovered from that mistake. content: In the heated battle between Microsoft, Google and a clutch of startups for early leadership in artificial intelligence, one name that’s conspicuously missing is IBM’s. Indeed, its absence from all major technological developments of the past two decades belies its status as a tech titan of a previous age and the most admired corporation in America for years. No company could come within sniffing distance of Big Blue’s 80% market share in computers.
But as the cliche goes, the higher you rise, the harder you fall. In February 1992, at the height of its power, IBM shocked investors when it reported revenues of $64.8 billion for 1991, down 6%. This was its first annual sales decline since 1946. With it came a $2.8 billion annual loss, the first in the company’s 80-year history. Coming just a year after General Motors’s $5.6 billion loss, it signalled the end of the American megacorp. Management guru Peter Drucker put it succinctly: “The Fortune 500 is over.""
Also read: Macs give Apple a chunkier India pie
Many of those Fortune 500 companies did eventually recover, but for IBM It was the beginning of the end. Despite major changes, including the unceremonious sacking of CEO John Akers, and layoffs, IBM (US) suffered a net loss of almost $16 billion from 1991 to 1993. The exit of Akers, a quintessential IBM-er, was a clear sign that the days of stability and continuity were over.
Big Blue’s big mistake
Abrupt though it seemed, IBM’s decline had started long before that. Despite having birthed the personal computer in 1981, the company refused to put its might behind it on the grounds that it couldn’t possibly carry out the tasks performed by a mainframe. Its initial sales estimate for PCs was a peak of 400,000. Since the big boys at the company held the tiny machine in disdain, the company violated its own policy and used chips and operating system software from two small companies – Intel and Microsoft, respectively.

This muddle should never have arisen. Tax uncertainty is bad for business. content: Taxation should never be like reading tea leaves. But the storm in a teacup over a goods and services tax (GST) demand of about ₹32,400 crore made of Infosys (now being relooked) suggests a system full of riddles. As reported, services were availed by Infosys from its overseas branches.
By one interpretation of India’s GST rules, this would have required “reverse charge"" tax payments on these imports by the company. Hence the tax bill. However, the services Infosys bought went into its software exports, which are tax-free and thus eligible for input tax credits.
So, if the company could anyway claim the tax back, why should it apply in the first place? A reverse charge mechanism does exist under GST. But its applicability in this case is unclear. On its part, Infosys has denied any evasion, arguing that GST simply isn’t applicable on stuff bought from its own foreign units.
The case is being examined by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence. Should some quirk or technicality mean it still owes money, then it’s the rules that would need sorting out. Such tax riddles create uncertainty for businesses. It would be best if tax authorities clarify what exactly the law says.",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/quick-edit/mint-quick-edit-infosys-gst-notice-service-export-input-tax-credit-taxation-tax-clarity-11722799082177.html

The company informed stock exchanges late Saturday about having received a communication from Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) about closure of “the pre-show cause notice proceedings for the financial year 2017-2018”.
“The Company had received and responded to a pre-show cause notice issued by DGGI for the period July 2017 to March 2022. The Company has now received a communication from DGGI closing the pre-show cause notice proceedings for the financial year 2017-2018. The GST amount as per the pre-show cause notice for this period was Rs 3,898 crore,” Infosys said in its filing on stock exchanges.
While the filing doesn’t mention about the status of the tax demand notice for rest of the years out of the total five-year period of 2017-18 to 2021-22, officials said the demand notice for the rest of the years is also likely to be withdrawn in the coming days. A decision could also happen at the adjudication stage, an official said.

The DGGI had slapped a Rs 32,403 crore notice on Infosys for services availed by the company from its overseas branches over a five-year period starting 2017.
Bengaluru-based Infosys, in a stock exchange filing Wednesday, had called the missive from the tax department a “pre-show cause” notice and said it believes the GST is not applicable on the expenses in contention.
On Thursday, the company informed stock exchanges that Karnataka state GST authority had withdrawn its notice. The company is now required to respond to only DGGI on the matter.
In its notice, the GST probe wing has invoked reverse charge mechanism, where the recipient of goods/services assumes the responsibility for tax payment, instead of the seller.

This is after the Bengaluru office of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) issued a pre-show cause notice to the country’s second-largest IT services firm, flagging that it had not paid ₹32,403.46 crore in integrated GST (IGST) over five years between July 2017 and March 2022 for “supply of services"" by its foreign branches.
On Thursday, Infosys informed stock exchanges that the Karnataka State GST authorities, a reference to the zonal office of DGGI, had withdrawn the pre-show cause notice and directed it to respond to DGGI's central authority on the matter. The company had received pre-show cause notice on the same matter from both the central and state offices of DGGI.
“No tax demand has been raised; only pre-show cause notices were sent,"" said the person cited above, who spoke on condition of not being named. “The (taxpayer’s) plea in light of the CBIC circular on import of services by a related person will likely be accepted.""
The CBIC (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) had on 26 June stated in a circular that services rendered by the overseas branches of an Indian firm would not attract GST. The circular came after the authority received representations from the IT industry in this regard.
CBIC is the apex indirect tax authority of the central government. The DGGI is part of the tax administration ecosystem.

IT industry body Nasscom on Thursday said the latest tax demand reflects a lack of understanding of the sector’s operating model.
It also said multiple companies are facing avoidable litigation and uncertainty.
The Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys on Wednesday said Karnataka State GST authorities have issued a pre-show cause notice for the payment of GST of ₹32,403 crore for the period July 2017 to March 2022 towards the expenses incurred by overseas branch offices of Infosys Limited.
Infosys argued that GST payments are eligible for credit or refund against the export of IT services.
In a statement, Nasscom said that government circulars issued based on recommendations of the GST Council must be honoured in enforcement mechanisms so that notices do not create uncertainty and negatively impact perceptions on India's ease of doing business.
“Recent media reports of a GST demand of over ₹320 billion ( ₹32,403 crore) reflects a lack of understanding of the industry's operating model. This is an industry-wide issue, and multiple companies are facing avoidable litigation, uncertainty, and concerns from investors and customers,” Nasscom said.
Nasscom argued that the GST enforcement authorities have been issuing notices for remittance by the Indian head office to its foreign branches for cases where there is no service between the head office and foreign branch for this RCM (reverse charge mechanism), ignoring that this is not a case of 'import of service' by the head office from the branch.

Intel’s stock plummeted at the end of last week, but it was in good company as the rest of the market raced after it in a chaotic start to trading for the week. Trading platforms added to the chaos after three of them went down during a panicked sell-off during the early hours of trading.
Sunday afternoon, Gelsinger quoted Proverbs—the New International Version translation. The bit of poetry came amidst a collapsing stock price at Intel following the news that the company had missed quarterly targets and would cut thousands of jobs.
“Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways” Proverbs 4:25-26 — Pat Gelsinger (@PGelsinger) August 4, 2024
“Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways,” Gelsinger posted, quoting Proverbs verse 4, lines 25 and 26.
Verse 4 is a bit from King Solomon where he gives out fatherly advice to his sons. The whole thing is an entreaty to the reader to stay on the straight and narrow, and avoid wicked thoughts and corrupt speech. Basically, keep your mouth shut and your eye on the prize.
Tweeting out Bible verses isn’t a good way to calm investor panic. Amid a consumer scandal and a changing chip market, news broke last week that Intel would cut thousands of jobs. When the chip manufacturer finally reported its quarterly earnings to investors on Thursday, the fallout was worse than expected.
Following the news that Intel would fall short of its projected earnings, the stock price took a tumble settling down 26% on Friday. It was Intel’s largest stock loss in 50 years. Intel said it would restructure its business and is looking to cut billions in costs, including 15% of its workforce.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- As they plan to move into their new home at the Intuit Dome, the Los Angeles Clippers have opened their first flagship store.
The store near the new arena offers team gear that can be customized, including basketballs with laser engraving. It also sells products for pets, kids and fans of all ages.
The team is preparing to move out of its shared space at Crypto.com Arena and into its new arena in Inglewood this upcoming season.
That also means not sharing retail space with the Lakers, giving them more floor room to offer a variety of branded products.

Lenovo,8983,2024-08-05T13:45:23Z,"Lenovo may have just leaked a new Legion Go ‘Lite’ console - here’s what we know Description: Well, that wasn’t meant to happen content: We loved the Lenovo Legion Go when we first reviewed it, but one of the main negatives we picked up on was its sizeable bulk. Now, it looks like Lenovo might address that concern with a new “Lite” version of the Legion Go, with a smaller seven-inch display, dual fans, and more.
Funnily enough, we only know this because Lenovo itself seems to have accidentally leaked the details. The info was spotted by user methylmorphia on Reddit, who noticed it in an FAQ section at the bottom of the official Lenovo Legion Go web page. The details were present when we first checked the site, yet seemed to have been scrubbed shortly after. Luckily, they’ve been captured in an archived version of the page.
In the FAQ (under the heading “What size is the Lenovo Legion Go display?”), Lenovo describes its handheld games console as having both seven-inch and eight-inch options. Right now, however, you can only get the Legion Go with an 8.8-inch screen.
That might suggest that two models are actually on the way: seven-inch and eight-inch versions to replace the 8.8-inch model. Either that or the eight-inch size mentioned on the Lenovo website refers to the 8.8-inch version.
Regardless, different sections of the FAQ also mentioned an HDMI connection and dual-fan cooling, both of which are absent in the current Legion Go model. Those new features could be attractive updates to users, if they do indeed arrive with a new version of the console.
In other words, someone at Lenovo might have jumped the gun and updated the official Legion Go website before time. As a result, details of an upcoming model could well have been leaked onto the internet, spoiling the surprise before Lenovo made a formal announcement.
‘Lite’ model on the way?
(Image credit: Future)
This isn’t the first time we’ve heard some of these details. In May, Windows Central reported that a new handheld console dubbed the Legion Go Lite was in the works and speculated that it might come with a smaller display or lower price.

Lenovo,8983,2024-08-05T13:38:02Z,"Lenovo Legion Go could get two new models, including smaller 7-inch version Description: Gamers looking for new handheld PCs could be in for good news, as Lenovo appears to working on more Legion Go devices. content: Lenovo Legion Go handhelds have quickly become some of the better models on the market, and it looks like they're about to get better. The company is reportedly announcing two different versions, as Lenovo has offered some hints about upcoming devices on its website, which we assume was done by mistake since the section has been removed.
A Reddit user spotted the error in an FAQ section on the Legion Go website. Regarding screen size, it says it ""varies depending on the model."" It also mentions that the device comes in 7- and 8-inch models, which is inaccurate for the current Legion Go. The only screen size currently available is 8.8 inches. If the company plans to change those sizes, it could have two different models with smaller screens than the current version in the works.
Another hint toward new models is the mention of dual fans and a dedicated HDMI port regardless of the display size. The current model doesn't have either of those features. If Lenovo adds them to the Legion Go, it could give it a leg up over some of the best gaming handhelds available.
The Legion Go isn't a perfect device, as users have complained about the Legion Space app and its lack of updates and sometimes broken functionality. Releasing new models won't solve the app issues, but it could help generate some excitement and help chip away at the dominance of the Steam Deck.
This could be a case of someone at Lenovo making a mistake, and these devices might not exist. However, we've heard reports of a smaller Legion Go in the past, so it doesn't seem far-fetched for one to launch in the near future.

The opulent White Star Line cruiser's ill-fated journey from Belfast to New York was one that was never completed due to the infamous collision with an iceberg that sent the vessel 12,500 feet to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean.
That of course led to the death of 1,500 passengers in a moment that shook the world and wrote a chapter in the history books that has continued to capture people's attention.
It's the stories from that night, and the mysterious haunting presence of the boat on the seabed, that led to the hugely successful and critically acclaimed Titanic film by James Cameron. A film that used real footage captured from the wreckage thanks to the filmmaker's own submarine voyages to the bottom of the Pacific.
Now, visitors to Birmingham's NEC can experience the Titanic story up close and personal thanks to the enthralling, educational, and emotional exhibition running throughout the summer.
I went along on the opening day of the exhibition to hopefully learn more about a moment in history that I have always been fascinated by. What I discovered at the exhibition was so much more than I could have expected.
I certainly hadn't expected so many West Midlands connections to the world's most famous nautical disaster. I knew about the ship's anchor being made in Netherton, and I've seen the replica from the same casting mould. I hadn't expected to see it so vividly in video footage shown on screens of the wreckage on the seabed.
I didn't know that the buttons for the crew's uniforms had been made by Firmin and Son, a company based in St Paul's Square in Birmingham. Equally as fascinating was learning that the ship's safes were built by and provided by Thomas Perry and Son, an iron forge in Bilston.

Ever wondered how it feels to step inside a painting? Well, now you can thanks to the brilliant Beyond Van Gogh exhibition that has just arrived at Birmingham NEC.
From sunflowers to self portraits, street cafes to swirling stars, there was certainly a wow factor as soon as you walked into the show. We wandered through floating petals set against the soothing clear blue sky of Van Gogh's Almond Blossom painting. The petals were everywhere, across all four walls, the pillars and floors, it was like entering a magical wonderland, like floating on top of the clouds.
Throughout the changing images set to music there was a sense of being immersed in nature, the colours so vibrant, the brush-strokes so real, the texture so three-dimensional. It was like being given a chance to step onto Van Gogh's canvas. I'd like to say it gave an insight into his mind but this is where I felt this exhibition fell a little short.

The Introduction Hall was filled with screens telling Van Gogh's story, told mostly through his letters to his brother Theo. It showed a humble existence, a yearning to paint that took him away from being a preacher and a desire for a brotherhood and connection but a sad deterioration into self destruction, ultimately cutting off his ear and sending himself to an asylum.
I found it sad to learn that he had painted the famous Starry Night picture from looking through the bars of his asylum window into the night sky. The introduction was great and I wanted more of his story within the exhibition.

A Birmingham street racer was clocked at 107mph in a 40mph zone as dozens of speeding tickets were issued to Brummies. It's part of West Midland Police's Road Harm Prevention Team operation aimed at targeting those involved in street racing or car cruising over the weekend.

Four section 59 warnings, which gives police the authority to seize vehicles being driven in an anti-social behaviour, were issued and two vehicles were tactically stung. It forms part of Operation Hercules, which targets people involved in street racing or car cruising where vehicles are driven in an anti-social or dangerous manner.
PC Mark Campbell said: “We need motorists to understand that we won’t tolerate illegal street racing or cruising on the region’s roads and will take action against motorists who flout the law and put other road users at risk.

HMD’s first original device, The Pulse Pro has a lot riding on its exquisitely narrow shoulders, being the model by which many will judge the whole present position of the company and possibly even rush to condemn the future of HMD as an entire entity too, so no pressure.
Available in three colours, Glacier Green, Twilight Purple and Black Ocean, the Pulse Pro is a good size at 6.5-odd-inches, yet weighs a near-nothing at 196g, all while feeling rather robust in the hand for a new 4G smartphone that costs a piffling £150.
Decidedly sleek, with a premium feel to it, everything you would hope for is on the outside, including an on/off switch/fingerprint reader, sim tray, volume, USB-C input and 3.5mm headphone jack, while round the back you’ll find a humongous 50MP camera (more on that to come) and that soon to be ubiquitous HMD logo. But, as attractive as an option as the Pulse Pro clearly is, it’s what’s on the inside that counts, so time to break out the metaphorical crowbar.
Running on the current latest version of Android (14), at the heart of the Pulse is a Unisoc T606, an entry-level octa-core processor with two beefy ARM Cortex A75 cores clocking up to 1.6GHz and six oomph-efficient ARM Cortex A55 cores clocking up to 1.6GHz, while the GPU appears in the shape of a Mali-G57 MP1, so the new HMD is more than geared up for speed, connectivity, graphics and gameplay, so don’t expect to experience any lag no matter how brutal your standard smart day. This comes served in conjunction with 128GB of storage, expandable to 256GB with the addition of a MicroSD card, and an ample 6GB RAM (virtual RAM options: 4GB, 6GB, 8GB). All of which means that the Pulse Pro is certainly saying all the right things.
Screen-wise, the 6.5-and-a-bit inch IPS LCD HD+ HID features a 1612 x 720 resolution, with a 90Hz refresh rate and typical brightness of 480-nits, so images, whether static or whizzing around like a blue-bottomed wotnot",https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/gadgets-tech/phones/best-hmd-nokia-phones-b1163405.html

This week will see over 50,000 music fans of all ages descend on Watergate Bay and Fistral, Newquay for the biggest music and surf event on the Cornish calendar. From Wednesday, August 7, until Sunday, August 11, fans can party on the clifftop site, which has hosted the festival since 2005 when it was first known as Nokia Unleashed.
Were you there for that first one when James Blunt headlined off the back of recent hit You’re Beautiful? It’s got a lot bigger, rockier and dancier since then.
Personal highlights include seeing it grow into a mammoth event after attending the very first one back when Razorlight meant something. Other highs include the underground drag queen madness of Coney Island (a secret, naughty club in the middle of a festival is always a good thing), meeting musical hero Wayne Coyne who later rolled around the crowd in his inflatable ball when the Flaming Lips played, and seeing some of the more underground bands that Boardmasters’ always manages to attract such as America’s White Denim.

Watching Stormzy attract one of the biggest crowds ever seen in Cornwall seven years ago was a game changer (he's finally back to headline this year), while the festival has upped its game in recent years with superb sets from Gorillaz, Idles, Self Esteem and, last year, The Last Dinner Party, proving why they have now become one of the most exciting British bands this decade. Here's a rundown of the high points (and a few lows) from the very beginning.

Nokia,8979,2024-08-01T12:39:57Z,"Amazon sues Nokia for infringing multiple AWS cloud computing patents Description: Amazon sues Nokia over a dozen patent infringements content: Amazon has filed a lawsuit against Nokia, accusing the Finnish telecomms giant of infringing on a dozen patents relating to cloud computing technology.
The lawsuit, initiated in the Delaware federal court earlier this week, Amazon alleges that Nokia unlawfully utilized technology developed by its cloud division, Amazon Web Services, to enhance its own cloud computing offerings.
Amazon claims Nokia has misappropriated AWS technology related to cloud infrastructure, security and performance.
Amazon sues Nokia over cloud computing parents
The complaint outlines Amazon’s history of cloud innovation, dating back to the early 2000s when the company started developing its cloud computing technology.
Amazon claims to have “democratiz[ed] access to computing infrastructure and software through its cloud-based, on-demand services model,” whereby previously businesses relied on expensive on-prem infrastructure.
Boasting more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies use AWS, Amazon says Nokia’s “new company strategy,” announced in 2020, six years after the company exited the mobile device market, “involve[s] leveraging Amazon’s innovative solutions, including Amazon’s patented technology, to address issues faced by cloud service providers.”
The company goes on to claim: “it was Amazon that pioneered in the cloud, and now Nokia is using Amazon's patented cloud innovations without permission.”

Nokia,8979,2024-08-01T03:00:45Z,"HMD To End Nokia Smartphone Launch And Focus On Feature Phones? Here’s What The Company Said Description: HMD has been making Nokia Android smartphones for over 5 years in the market but now it is changing its focus in countries like India. content: HMD launched its own branded smartphones in the Indian market recently looking to start a new chapter in the country. HMD has been and will make Nokia phones for consumers but the company has shared an interesting update around its future plans for the smartphone segment.
Speaking in an interview, Jean-Francois Baril, Founder of HMD Global pointed out that HMD will now focus on its own brand for smartphones.
The Indian market was excited with the comeback of Nokia with Android smartphones manufactured by HMD Global in 2016 but consumers haven’t seen enough value in their devices which is evident from the industry analyst data over the years. HMD now feels that it wants to start on a clean slate and give the HMD branding enough room and less intrusion from the legacy of Nokia.
End Of Nokia In India?
Baril was even quoted saying that that company is happy to focus on Nokia phones but only for the feature phone segment, which is still a 300 million strong market in countries like india. For smartphones, Nokia doesn’t matter too much, to be honest. But, for feature phones, it matters. It is a major transformation,” he was quoted saying in this report.
Nokia is a heavyweight in the market but even that brand needs strong core products to justify its marketing hype from the company. HMD has tried its best to compete with Chinese brands in the country and give them a better fight with specs-based products.
Having Nokia alive in the feature phone segment does have its merits but even there the company would need to innovate rather than dish out iconic models to appeal to a different consumer bracket.
HMD claims it is going to see India as an important market but it clearly needs a revised strategy to succeed in a tough country and if it plans to bring more 5G devices than 4G, as Baril said in the interview, the pricing game has to be smart and strong.",https://www.news18.com/tech/hmd-to-end-nokia-smartphone-launch-and-focus-on-feature-phones-heres-what-the-company-said-8985815.html

Read on to discover the insights that made him ‘The Man Who Sees Tomorrow’. content: No management guru has held as much sway in the boardrooms of Indian companies as the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad. As the Paul and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor of Corporate Strategy at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Prahalad was twice ranked the world's most influential business thinker by ""Thinkers 50.""
Through the 1990s, following the significant economic liberalization in India in 1991, opportunities abounded across various sectors. Indian businesses eagerly pursued these prospects, often overlooking essential factors like competence and capability. Companies traditionally focused on electronics ventured into power plant construction, while real estate firms explored telecommunications. Amid this rush, Prahalad's voice stood out, cautioning against unrelated diversifications. In workshops, closed-door sessions, and one-on-one meetings, he advised companies to consider their core competencies and focus on their strengths.
Prahalad believed that, although India had few global brands at the time, this was not a liability. Instead, he argued that India's genius was unique and different from the rest of the world
While some heeded his counsel, others couldn't resist the lure of the next big thing, influenced by the era's success stories like GE, a diversified American conglomerate, with businesses ranging from aircraft engines to financial services. Prahalad often cited examples like Sony's expertise in miniaturization or Philips in optical media to illustrate his points.

During a period when Apple was struggling after Steve Jobs' departure and John Sculley's leadership setbacks, Prahalad still regarded the company as a visionary force. He believed that Apple's recovery, which would indeed occur a few years later, would be driven by its core strength: user-friendliness. As he explained in a Business Today magazine interview, “Yo",https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/ck-prahalad-ckp-apple-sony-business-management-corporate-strategy-bottom-of-the-pyramid-11722053098470.html

Well, not really unless you enter a fool’s paradise. Here we recapitulate six key investing lessons one can learn from the Oracle of Omaha content: Whether you are an early investor or a veteran, learning the basics of investing requires a long practice, failures, disappointments and success as well. Else, you can learn these from someone who has been there, and done that. They say that an average person learns from his mistakes, whereas a wise person learns from other’s mistakes.
In order to become a pro in investing, could one find a better person than Warren Buffett? Let us dig deeper into the key investing lessons the Oracle of Omaha has shared in his speeches and talks.
Key investing lessons to learn from Warren Buffett: 1. Buy at the right price: Warren Buffett often said that it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.
This effectively means investment in a company with a formidable competitive edge —bought at a fair price — will be more fruitful in the long run vis-à-vis a company that has fewer chances of excelling in the long run. For instance, Buffett has invested in Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, among others.
Meanwhile, his firm Berkshire Hathaway has recently now sold nearly half his stake in Apple. For more details, one can read this Livemint article.
2. Buy in bulk when prices are low: Warren Buffett believes in keeping massive cash in hand in order to make the most of an opportunity of low prices. He says when it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.
Notably, cash reserves of Berkshire Hathaway have now hit $277 billion. Before Buffett’s firm sold its stake in Apple, it was sitting on a cash pile of $189 billion.
3. Investing is more about managing emotions: Warren Buffett often said that investing is more about managing emotions. He used to say that one should become greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.

The CPU includes two ""Kryo"" performance cores (up to 2 GHz) and six efficiency cores (1.6 GHz), which are slightly slower compared to the existing Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC. The Adreno GPU is designed to handle Full HD displays and deliver up to 90 frames per second, according to Qualcomm. Additionally, the camera supports up to 84 MP shots with a dual 12-bit image processor.
Qualcomm highlights that the chip includes AI-based echo cancellation technology for enhanced audio processing, with noise suppression algorithms designed to reduce background noise in busy environments. It also features improved navigation capabilities with dual-frequency navIC positioning and native support for mobile payment platforms. navIC is an autonomous satellite navigation system operated by India, which is likely a key market for Qualcomm's new chip.

Learn More
Generative AI is already changing the way many of us work — and it is set to completely revolutionize some roles.
In fact, according to one bold new prediction, more than 92% of information and communication technology (ICT) jobs will either be highly or moderately transformed by AI.
This assertion comes from the AI-Enabled ICT Workforce Consortium, which has released the new comprehensive report, “The Impact of Generative AI.” The consortium was formed in April by some of the world’s largest big tech companies — including Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Intel, Cisco, Accenture, Indeed and Eightfold AI — to address challenges with AI talent.
“Gen AI has the potential to reinvent fundamental aspects of our daily lives,” said Ryan Oakes, global health and public service industry lead at Accenture. “We are tackling the opportunities and challenges that the workforce will face as generative AI becomes increasingly prevalent.”
Seven ‘job families’ to be most disrupted
To gain a broad understanding of AI’s impact on the workforce, the consortium analyzed 47 specific ICT job roles across seven “job families.” Those families included business and management; cybersecurity; data science; design and user experience; infrastructure and operations; software development; and testing and quality assurance.
Roles were rated low, moderate or high transformation. Moderate- and -high indicating that at least 50% of principal skills will be impacted by AI. Jobs were also analyzed by seniority level, with the consortium finding that 96% of entry-level and 84% of mid-level positions will be significantly impacted by AI.
While AI will have an effect to some extent on all job roles, the consortium projects the biggest transformations to occur in business and management, design and user experience and testing and quality assurance.

A Santander customer was left baffled when the bank suggested he visit a branch in another country to carry out his banking. The man had contacted the bank after experiencing issues with the cash machine at his local branch in Weston-Super-Mare.
He queried: ""Second time asking. Is the cash point at Santander Weston-Super-Mare accepting cash yet? "" In response, the bank said: ""Apologies for our late reply! We've queried this with our ATM management team and as soon as we have an update, we'll certainly let you know.""
""The next closest Santander branch is: Queen Street, Cardiff, South Glamorgan."" The customer was understandably confused by this, responding: ""Cardiff is in a different country and much as I love Wales, I'm not driving there for this. Look forward to your update.""

Indeed, Cardiff is nearly a two-hour drive from Weston-Super-Mare, including crossing the Bristol Channel via the Prince of Wales bridge. The bank acknowledged that this might be a bit far for the man to travel for his banking needs.
A representative responded: ""Appreciate this is a little too far! At the end of my reply, I let you know deposits can be made using the Post Office too, with your Santander card. Hopefully this is more convenient.""
The customer agreed that this would indeed be a more suitable alternative for his banking needs. Santander later responded with good news, stating: ""We're happy to confirm that the branch's ATMs are up and running again at the Weston-Super-Mare branch.""

Nine major bank changes are coming in August 2024 - for Santander, First Direct, Lloyds, Halifax customers and more. Among the changes are axed services and interest rate shake-ups amid the ongoing Cost of Living crisis.
It comes days after the Bank of England cut interest rates. Speaking last week, Emily Williams, director of research at Savills, said: “Today’s base rate cut will give buyers increasing confidence that mortgage rates are on course to return to more affordable levels, gradually improving the range of buyers in the market and their buying power. We expect this to feed through into more market activity in the autumn, particularly if there are further cuts to the base rates in the coming months.
“Capacity for house price growth will remain limited until there is a more significant reduction in the cost of debt. However, this is a clear signal to the market that the Bank feels it has turned a corner in the battle against inflation, and it should give most buyers and sellers confidence that the market will improve as we head into 2025.”

First Direct
First Direct is doing away with its text message banking service, it has told account holders in an email. The bank, which has never had branches, said its text message service will end on 10 August, meaning that First Direct customers will need to use its app or online service in order to check balances.
First Direct launched in 1989 as a telephone-only bank and has provided a text message service for 25 years. The changes mean that monthly and weekly mini-bank statements will no longer be sent to those who have opted in with the service.

Santander has alerted customers to a savings account which comes with a generous interest rate. Savers can earn up to £240 extra through the Santander Edge account.
The account offers a rate of 6% for the first 12 months, allowing customers to quickly build up interest on their cash. The rate is available on balances of up to £4,000, which equates to £240 interest over a year.
Households are often advised to shop around for the best savings accounts, either at their existing bank or a rival, as it's an easy way to make some extra cash. Many customers stick with the same savings account for years despite it having a poor rate and pocketing them hardly anything in interest.

According to disclosures filed on its website, Tata Sons had no loans from banks and other financial institutions as of 30 June, as against ₹18,809 crore or 44% of its total liabilities in the same period last year.
The move towards becoming debt-free is being seen as a step towards avoiding getting listed under a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guideline, because loans from financial institutions is one of the metrics assessed by the regulator when it looks at classifying upper-layer NBFCs such as Tata Sons. Upper layer NBFCs like Tata Sons have to get listed by September 2025.
According to an analyst who did not wish to be named, while top 10 NBFCs by asset size would automatically be tagged upper layer, it is unclear whether assets would mean loans or even investments in group companies, as in the case of Tata Sons.
The Economic Times had reported on 2 August that RBI “is said to be agreeable"" to a proposed recast for a waiver of Tata Sons' listing.
A plan to shed debt
Under Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who was reappointed chairman for a second five-year term in February 2022, the Tata Group has considered retiring some of the debt of group companies like Tata Steel and Tata Power.
At the same time, the share of dividend income of the group firms has also increased. In fact, it managed to wipe off almost all of its debt on account of the ₹42,536.2 crore it got from IT services bellwether Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS), as per Mint's research.

The recent ransomware attack that basically took down over 300 small Indian banks and has rendered ATM usage and online payments has been attributed to the notorious RansomEXX group
What happened was that C-Edge Technologies Ltd., a joint venture between Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and State Bank of India was attacked using a sophisticated variant of their ransomware according to a report by CloudSEK
The attack primarily affected Brontoo Technology Solutions, a significant collaborator with C-Edge. Following the attack, Brontoo filed a report with CertIn, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team. CloudSEK’s threat research team identified that the attack chain began with a misconfigured Jenkins server, which the attackers exploited.

Key Findings from the CloudSEK Report
CloudSEK’s report highlighted several key findings. The ransomware group behind the attack is RansomEXX v2.0, which is notorious for targeting large organizations and demanding substantial ransom payments. The attack began with a misconfigured Jenkins server, exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2024-23897) that allows attackers to gain secure shell access via port 22. This incident underscores the growing threat of supply chain attacks and the need for robust security measures across entire ecosystems.
RansomEXX v2.0 is an advanced variant of the RansomEXX ransomware, known for its sophisticated techniques and high ransom demands. Initially known as Defray777, RansomEXX rebranded in 2020 and has since evolved to counter increasing defensive measures. This variant shows enhanced encryption techniques, evasion tactics, and payload delivery methods.
The infection vectors and tactics used by RansomEXX v2.0 are diverse and effective. The initial access vectors inclu",https://www.firstpost.com/tech/cybersecurity-experts-reveal-what-exactly-happened-in-the-ransomware-attacks-that-took-down-300-banks-13799726.html

Tencent’s online juggernaut WeChat and ByteDance’s Douyin are both reportedly in the firing line, with Apple “ramping up pressure” on both over the practice.
According to a new report, the pair are being pushed “to make fundamental changes to China’s most popular apps.”
Apple goes after WeChat and Douyin
As reported by Bloomberg, Apple “in recent months has demanded the two companies close loopholes that their in-app creators employ to funnel users to external payment systems.” Apple reportedly warned Tencent in May that it would reject updates to the app unless it gets rid of links used by mini-game developers to accept payments off-platform, which is banned under App Store guidelines. Apple also reportedly told Tencent it had to disable WeChat’s in-game messaging feature for the same reason, however, the company has yet to comply.
Likewise in June, Apple told ByteDance it would stop accepting Douyin (China’s version of TikTok) because of “similar payment loopholes.”
The report notes the move is “unusually aggressive” in the content of the market in China, and could “alienate creators in a key arena.” The move is also notable because it draws attention to Apple’s App Store business model, which has been dubbed anticompetitive in other markets, including the EU.
Apple’s stringent business model, which precludes developers from linking to external payment methods in most places, has been a point of contention in several lawsuits, the most high-profile example being the spat with Epic Games in 2020.

Tencent,8980,2024-08-02T15:59:49Z,"Apple is fighting Tencent and ByteDance over in-app payments in China Description: The iPhone maker is demanding that the companies close loopholes that direct customers to third-party purchase options. content: Apple has been pressuring ByteDance and Tencent to close loopholes in China that funnel customers to external payment systems for making in-app purchases, according to a report by Bloomberg . Anyone living in the West knows the drill here. Apple wants that 30 percent commission.
Reporting indicates this pressure campaign began in May. Apple allegedly warned Tencent that it would reject crucial WeChat updates if it didn’t eliminate the ability for users to make payments outside of Apple’s ecosystem. Tencent complied with the original request, issuing an update in July, but Apple went one step further.
WeChat is home to thousands of third-party mini-games and experiences. Apple asked Tencent to disable in-game chat between creators and players, as that's another theoretical loophole that could funnel users to third-party payment systems. Tencent has yet to agree to this request.
Back in June, Apple reportedly did something similar with ByteDance. It threatened to withhold updates of Douyin, which is basically the Chinese version of TikTok, unless it plugged any gaps that steer users away from that much-coveted 30 percent commission. According to Bloomberg, ByteDance has yet to issue a formal response.
These are aggressive moves on the part of Apple. China is the world’s largest smartphone market, sure, but the iPhone isn’t the dominant brand throughout the country. As a matter of fact, the phone failed to crack the top five in sales last quarter and the company recently experienced a 6.5 percent decline in profits.
It’s also worth noting that both ByteDance and Tencent aren’t happy corporate warriors looking out for the little guy. These massive companies levy their own commissions on creators and likely didn’t want Apple cutting into their bottom lines.

The loopholes are linked to mini-apps that allow users of Tencent's social-messaging app WeChat and ByteDance's short-video app Douyin to play games, hail taxis, and make online purchases without leaving the app.
Apple reportedly told both companies they need to prevent mini-app creators from including links to outside payment systems that circumvent its commission system. Apple said it would not approve future updates to WeChat or Douyin until the companies complied.
Apple also has asked Tencent to disable in-game chats between developers and users, because they can also be used to send links, according to Bloomberg. Tencent has reportedly pushed back against the idea due to the negative impact it would have on the game experience.
The report characterized the moves by Apple as ""unusually aggressive"" in China, suggesting they may inflame tensions at a time when its business practices are under scrutiny by antitrust regulators around the world.

Speaking to TNM, she said the increase in working hours will be the death of their careers. “If we are working for 14 hours and travelling for two or three hours, there is no time for us to upskill and prepare for promotions. They will then fire us and claim that it was because we did not upskill, when in reality they are responsible for this,” she said.
“I am a single mother, my 9-year-old son suffers from chronic diseases. For that, I took leaves. My company fired me on the basis of my leaves and asked me to put down my papers,” said a worker from West Bengal, who has approached KITU for help. “We are moving the Labour Commissioner’s office. I need justice. My family needs justice,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified. Several incidents of women IT workers being denied maternity leave and pregnant workers being laid off had emerged recently.
Representatives of the Union of IT and ITES Employees (UNITE), an active union working for the welfare of workers in the industry in Tamil Nadu, who attended the protest assured that similar unions from other states stand with KITU in their fight against the proposal.
Extending working hours will further impact the health of IT workers, KITU representatives said, citing a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The report said that “working 55 or more hours per week is associated with an estimated 35% higher risk of a stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease, compared to working 35-40 hours a week.”
The proposed amendment has faced strong opposition from tech workers and workers’ unions led by KITU across Bengaluru over the past two weeks, in the form of gate meetings and street campaigns.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka/we-are-workers-not-your-slaves-it-workers-in-bengaluru-protest-against-14-hour-work

Matching the right talent to an open role can be challenging, both for recruiters and jobseekers.

On Thursday, Workday announced that two tools from HR company HiredScore, AI for Recruiting and AI for Talent Mobility, will now be available on the platform, allowing organizations to leverage AI for their employment needs.

It also shows candidates other job openings for which they are qualified, helping connect businesses to the best applicants.

""Workday is delivering AI to rapidly transform how organizations manage talent – to help them find the right person for the right job at the right time.""
HiredScore AI for Talent Mobility presents employees with career development opportunities and tailored internal job recommendations, which, according to the release, increases internal application rates by 40% and an employee's likelihood of applying to an internal job by 2.3 times.

That’s not its lowest price to date — we’ve seen it fall to $642 in select configurations before — but the Ocean Band model rarely dips below $719, unlike the others.

The convicted felon claimed he was “totally for” electric cars and even went so far as to call them “incredible.”

Now, Trump has shared a little more about his sudden change of heart, and it’s related to the backing he’s gained from Tesla boss Elon Musk, of course. The Republican nominee admitted he felt he had “no choice” but to support EVs after the Tesla boss pledged his support to the Trump campaign, reports Business Insider. As the site reports:
At a rally in Georgia on Sunday, Trump told the crowd he supported electric cars but thought people should still have access to gas vehicles. “I’m for electric cars. I have to be because, you know, Elon endorsed me very strongly,” Trump told the crowd. “So, I have no choice.” He then clarified that he only supports them as a “small slice” of the larger auto industry. “You want to have gas-propelled cars. You want to have hybrids. You want to have every kind of car,” he said.

This marks a serious turn in opinions from Trump, who has previously called for an end to an EV mandate that doesn’t exist, branded the electrification of the auto industry a “green new scam” and even went so far as to pledge an end to EV sales.
Still, Trump does at least have one EV that he actually likes, and it’s the one you’d expect it to be: the Cybertruck. Trump said he was a “huge fan” of the divisive truck earlier this year, according to Musk.

Five secretaries of state on Monday urged Elon Musk to fix his social media platform X's artificial intelligence search assistant after it allegedly shared false information about the 2024 presidential election .
Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had endorsed Republican presidential nominee Trump before Biden quit the race and backed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.
Within hours of Biden dropping out, a Grok post claimed, ""The ballot deadline has passed for several states for the 2024 election,"" according to the letter to Musk from the secretaries of state, who oversee their states' elections.
The post claimed that those states included the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico, along with Alabama, Indiana, Ohio, Texas and Washington, according to the letter, which was sent on the letterhead of Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon.
""In all nine states the opposite is true,"" said the letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post.
""The ballots are not closed, and upcoming ballot deadlines would allow for changes to candidates listed on the ballot for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States,"" the letter said.

The iPhone maker joined mega-cap tech peers NvIdia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon in plunging as 6.5%, wiping out roughly $900 billion in total market cap.
The share slide followed a weak payrolls report on Friday that pushed investors across the globe to safe assets and spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will have to soon cut interest rates to aid growth.

The Fed on Wednesday kept interest rate cuts unchanged, hinting the highly-anticipated move may come in September.
However, noted economist Jeremy Siegel called on the central bankers to immediately make emergency cuts as the market tanked.
Chip stocks, which had spurred fresh AI excitement from tech investors, were also hit hard by economic doubts on Monday. Intel, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom fell nearly 7%.
Intel had already suffered one of its worst trading days in 40 years on Friday when its stock price nosedived more than 25% after the company presented disappointing earnings and a cost-cutting plan that would lay off 15% of its workforce.
Shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet — the three biggest providers of cloud-computing services — fell in recent weeks as their earnings reports sowed doubts that their margins could take a hit from the billions of dollars being spent on AI.
“Expectations have arguably become too high for the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Their success has made them untouchable in the eyes of investors and when they fall short of greatness, out come the knives,” said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.

Procter and Gamble.
One of the biggest names in us consumer goods is seeing organic sales growth decline quarter by quarter.
Is this an example of a larger consumer trend?
Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman joins me now with a closer look, Julie, well, a lot of the economists and macro strategists that we speak to and whose notes we read, they look not just at the economic data, but they look at companies reports.

They listen to company conference calls to try to figure out what's going on in the economy.
One of those folks is Connors, he's the founder at Peachtree Creek Investments and he tweeted this chart today and he said this earnings season has done way more to convince me of the current overall disinflationary trend than any economic data we've gotten this year.
And uh, Procter and Gamble is a consumer goods giant, of course, with a vast swath of different types of goods that touch different parts of us life, right?
And people spend money on.
And so he points that you've got this slowing organic sales growth last quarter, organic sales growth at just 2%.
And that was the slowest in six years and it was less than 3.4% estimated part of this has to do with lower prices.
The P and G is charging which speaks to that disinflationary trend.
We also earlier today heard from Ceo John Mueller of P and G and he talked about some of the cross currents affecting the company.
I don't doubt that some uh shoppers are uh more cautious, that would make sense.
But if we look at a couple of things, a couple of uh data points that, that we have access to one is uh the um the",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/slowing-p-g-sales-consumer-220108782.html

The stock is understandably down, but this is not a thesis-changing report. Revenue in three months ended June 30 totaled $20.53 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $20.74 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Sales were essentially flat year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 2% on an annual basis to $1.40, topping estimates by 3 cents, LSEG data showed. Procter & Gamble Why we own it : We like P & G because demand for its household and personal care products does not tend to fluctuate based on the economy. It has effectively navigated high inflation over the past two years. It's the kind of defensive stock that is good to own while the economy slows. Competitors : Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever Weight in Club portfolio : 2.35% Most recent buy : April 3, 2024 Initiated : April 7, 2022 Bottom line It's not surprising that shares of Procter & Gamble are lower after reporting a mixed quarter with guidance for its fiscal 2025 that merely met expectations — especially considering the stock closed Monday at a record high of $169.93. But the magnitude of Tuesday's declines, down about 6%, is excessive. Nothing in Tuesday's report suggests that P & G — a well-run company with a consistent track record of shareholder returns and earnings growth — is straying from its long-term course. Some of P & G's slide may simply be that investors are looking for more exciting stories at this point in the economic and interest-rate cycle. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates at its September meeting, a buzzier story looks like fellow Club holding Stanley Black & Decker , up nearly 8% on the back of its earnings report Tuesday. ""I don't want you to outthink it: Procter is a much better company than 99% of the companies you could buy today,"" Jim Cramer said on Tuesday's Morn",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/pg-stock-deserves-to-be-down-after-a-messy-quarter-but-not-this-much.html

It is now available in the Connect tool for most employees, and we are partnering with geo HR teams to expand access to all employees globally. The Security Core Priority is not a check-the-box compliance exercise; it is a way for every employee and manager to commit to—and be accountable for—prioritizing security, and a way for us to codify your contributions and to recognize you for your impact. We all must act with a security-first mindset, speak up, and proactively look for opportunities to ensure security in everything we do.
The core priority will have two parts:
Core and common elements that apply to all employees
An optional section for employees to further specify how they will activate the Security Core Priority based on their role, team, org, etc.
All employees will set their Security Core Priority as part their first FY25 Connect, with the intent that during regular Connect conversations, you and your manager will discuss your Security Core Priority progress and impact.

According to an internal memo viewed by Reuters, the Detroit automaker is now rewarding its top 5% of employees with 150% bonuses, higher than what was available in the previous system, to better attract and retain the talent needed to achieve its goals in the cut-throat automotive transformation to electric vehicles.

“To ensure GM has the talent needed to achieve our ambitious goals, a more intentional process is required that sets clear expectations for performance and holds people accountable,” according to the memo, which was first reported by Reuters.

Legacy automakers like GM and Ford have been tweaking their performance evaluation systems for U.S. salaried employees to better compete with the stock-heavy pay packages of EV rivals like Tesla and Rivian.
GM’s new performance ranking system evaluates employees on a five-scale system, from “significantly exceeds expectations” to” does not meet expectations.” Employee bonuses are tied to their ranking. The company has about 53,000 salaried employees in the U.S.

“GM is proud to have a culture where we foster and reward high performance, which will help us attract and retain top talent in a competitive industry environment. That includes everything from ensuring employees know what is expected of them, providing feedback so they can develop, and rewarding them for their performance,” a GM spokesperson said.
GM employees will be evaluated on the updated rankings during their year-end performance review, the spokesperson said.

Here's every truck the company has made with one under the hood. content: When you think of a truck an average person might own, the open-bed design of an adventure-ready pickup truck probably springs to mind. However, when looking at a Chevy Tahoe, you might assume it's an SUV. In truth, the vehicle is actually an example of body-on-frame construction, as the Tahoe uses a truck frame as its skeleton. This design gives the Tahoe a robustness that blurs the line between SUV and truck.
On a side note, you might wonder why the GMC Yukon is part of this entry. That's because it is an example of badge engineering — the Yukon has same design and parts as the Tahoe, but a different insignia. That means it sits in the same class as the Tahoe: It's an SUV that is also a truck. However, while the Yukon is a rebadged Tahoe, it's not a carbon copy. It can tow more weight and has slightly more seating space and legroom for each passenger, albeit with worse fuel efficiency.
The Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon have utilized countless LS engines since the turn of the century. Some of these engine blocks included the 4.8-liter LR4 (aka The Vortec 4800) from 2000 to 2006, the 5.3-liter L59 from 2002 to 2006, and the 6.2-liter L86 from 2015 to the present day.",https://www.slashgear.com/1627578/ls-v8-engine-general-motors-every-truck-powered-by/

The share slide followed a weak U.S. payrolls report on Friday that pushed investors to safe assets and spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will have to soon cut interest rates to aid growth.
Over the weekend, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had halved its stake in Apple - the conglomerate's top holding - in a stock-selling spree that raised worries about the outlook for the tech industry.
Meanwhile, Nvidia shares took a hit from a report that the launch of its upcoming AI chips could be delayed by three months due to design flaws, which could impact customers such as Facebook-parent Meta, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft.
After driving gains on Wall Street for more than a year, big technology stocks have come under pressure in the past few weeks also on signs that the payoff from hefty AI investments would take longer than some investors had initially hoped.
Shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - the three biggest providers of cloud-computing services - fell as their earnings reports dashed big bets of hefty AI investments translating quickly into growth.

The group currently includes Apple, the iPhone maker; Microsoft, the Windows PC software vendor; cloud computing giant, Google’s parent Alphabet; Amazon.com, the online retail and cloud computing behemoth; Nvidia, the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock of this decade; Meta Platforms, a social media titan that’s leading the design of highly potent open source AI models; and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, a pioneer in the electric vehicle space.
All but one of the current Magnificent Seven stocks have been instrumental in lifting the S&P 500’s returns during the past year. However, Tesla stock, which is down 10% year-to-date, has been a laggard, and its performance is distorting the group’s otherwise stellar performance record. The EV maker is falling short of the elite group’s performance-based glory.

Read on to discover the insights that made him ‘The Man Who Sees Tomorrow’. content: No management guru has held as much sway in the boardrooms of Indian companies as the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad. As the Paul and Ruth McCracken Distinguished University Professor of Corporate Strategy at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Prahalad was twice ranked the world's most influential business thinker by ""Thinkers 50.""
Through the 1990s, following the significant economic liberalization in India in 1991, opportunities abounded across various sectors. Indian businesses eagerly pursued these prospects, often overlooking essential factors like competence and capability. Companies traditionally focused on electronics ventured into power plant construction, while real estate firms explored telecommunications. Amid this rush, Prahalad's voice stood out, cautioning against unrelated diversifications. In workshops, closed-door sessions, and one-on-one meetings, he advised companies to consider their core competencies and focus on their strengths.
Prahalad believed that, although India had few global brands at the time, this was not a liability. Instead, he argued that India's genius was unique and different from the rest of the world
While some heeded his counsel, others couldn't resist the lure of the next big thing, influenced by the era's success stories like GE, a diversified American conglomerate, with businesses ranging from aircraft engines to financial services. Prahalad often cited examples like Sony's expertise in miniaturization or Philips in optical media to illustrate his points.

During a period when Apple was struggling after Steve Jobs' departure and John Sculley's leadership setbacks, Prahalad still regarded the company as a visionary force.

In order to become a pro in investing, could one find a better person than Warren Buffett? Let us dig deeper into the key investing lessons the Oracle of Omaha has shared in his speeches and talks.
Key investing lessons to learn from Warren Buffett: 1. Buy at the right price: Warren Buffett often said that it’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.
This effectively means investment in a company with a formidable competitive edge —bought at a fair price — will be more fruitful in the long run vis-à-vis a company that has fewer chances of excelling in the long run. For instance, Buffett has invested in Apple, American Express and Coca-Cola, among others.
Meanwhile, his firm Berkshire Hathaway has recently now sold nearly half his stake in Apple. For more details, one can read this Livemint article.
2. Buy in bulk when prices are low: Warren Buffett believes in keeping massive cash in hand in order to make the most of an opportunity of low prices. He says when it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.
Notably, cash reserves of Berkshire Hathaway have now hit $277 billion. Before Buffett’s firm sold its stake in Apple, it was sitting on a cash pile of $189 billion.
3. Investing is more about managing emotions: Warren Buffett often said that investing is more about managing emotions. He used to say that one should become greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.

Mitsubishi,8979,2024-08-01T03:23:38Z,"MG topples Mitsubishi to offer Australia's strongest new car warranty Description: MG now offers a 10-year, 250,000km warranty across its entire range, beating even Mitsubishi when it comes to coverage. content: MG Motor Australia is launching a market-leading new car warranty across its entire range.
From today, August 1, it’s moving to a 10-year, 250,000km warranty, replacing the seven-year, unlimited-kilometre warranty coverage it currently offers on its vehicles.
This applies not only to the brand’s combustion-powered vehicles, but also its electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

All models also have a seven-year, unlimited-kilometre anti-perforation and paint warranty.

There is a caveat with MG’s new warranty. If your vehicle is being used for commercial purposes, the warranty coverage is reduced to seven years or 160,000km – whichever comes first.
“We are listening to our customers,” said MG Motor Australia chief commercial officer Giles Belcher, noting a longer warranty can make new car buyers more confident in a brand.
“MG’s 10-year warranty delivers unmatched peace of mind and ensures that you are fully supported on every journey.
“When it comes time for our customers to upgrade their car, we want them to turn to us first. We have a stack of great product in market and more on its way, so we want people to try us sooner than later.”

Coinciding with the longer warranty, MG has also slashed prices of its ZS EV and MG 4.
While Mitsubishi introduced a 10-year warranty in 2020, it has only 200,000km of coverage. It’s also only valid if you service within Mitsubishi’s dealer network, otherwise it maxes out at five years or 100,000km.
It’s unclear if other companies will follow MG and Mitsubishi’s example and move to 10-year warranties.
Warranties have continued to get longer over the years. Hyundai Australia led the charge for five-year warranties, introducing its then-market leading coverage in 1999.
Kia subsequently introduced a seven-year, unlimited-kilometre warranty in 2014, with companies like GWM and SsangYong subsequently following suit.

Now, Mitsubishi is getting in on the action, and these companies are working together “to further accelerate initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and a zero-traffic-accident society”, which will involve looking at electrification and software development.
They’re touting the advantage of integrating the technologies and knowledge of each company to help find synergies and “new business opportunities”.
Nissan and Honda, in a subsequent press release, have confirmed they will “consider supplementing models from a short-term to medium- to long-term perspective”, suggesting there’ll be some platform-sharing between the two brands.
There’s no mention of Mitsubishi in this, however the three-diamond brand already shares platforms with Nissan.

In the short term, Honda and Nissan have reached an agreement on models and regions to be complemented by each company, with both companies agreeing on the outline of a “product review system”.
They note this includes not only EVs but also combustion-powered vehicles.
Honda and Nissan are also working on a next-generation “software-defined vehicle” (SDV) platform.
They aim to complete their basic research on the project in approximately one year, before considering the possibility of mass production.

Engineers have also retuned the suspension and electric power steering based on customer feedback, yielding what it claims to be greater ride comfort and steering feel.
The updated Outlander PHEV will go on sale in Japan in the northern autumn (September-November 2024).
While it would appear likely these changes would also filter through to export models, Mitsubishi Motors Australia hasn’t confirmed launch timing for the updated model locally.
Additionally, the updated Outlander PHEV will gain available ventilated front seats, Aniline leather upholstery, and a 12-speaker Yamaha sound system.

Mitsubishi says it has redesigned the doors “to provide the best acoustic space”, according to its translated press release.
The infotainment touchscreen has grown from 9.0 inches to 12.3 inches.

However, it has a new rival in the shape of the BYD Sealion 6. Despite only launching in June, already 482 examples have been sold.

Since the turn of the decade, Ford and Isuzu have all launched new versions of the Everest and MU-X, respectively. Meanwhile, the Pajero Sport looks much the same as it did back in 2015.
The car on test here is a pre-update model. There are exterior cosmetic tweaks and a new three-spoke steering wheel for 2024, but it’s hardly a major update. Prices are up as well, to the tune of $1700 for the GLS on test here.
The big, bulky Triton-based SUV clearly still holds appeal to Australian new car buyers, as 4356 were sold over the first half of this year.
But is it time to pivot towards fresher metal, leaving the Pajero Sport to enjoy a quiet retirement?
How much does the Mitsubishi Pajero Sport cost?
The GLS on test here sits in the middle of the Pajero Sport range, as the cheapest of the seven-seat variants.

The hope is that by working together, the three Japanese automakers can catch up to their rivals in the race to introduce more technologically advanced vehicles in the future.
It’s another example of big, global automakers pooling their resources in the interest of defraying costs and finding more efficient ways to introduce new EVs to the marketplace. The inclusion of Mitsubishi “will not only add new knowledge and strengths but will also provide further synergies that can only be generated by the three companies,” Nissan and Honda said in a statement.
It’s another example of big, global automakers pooling their resources in the interest of defraying costs and finding more efficient ways to introduce new EVs
This is not the first joint venture for any of these companies. Honda paired up with General Motors to jointly develop EVs, only to dissolve the partnership several years later. (The newly released Honda Prologue is built on GM’s Ultium platform.) Several months later, Honda teamed up with Nissan with similar goals in mind. And Nissan is already part of a decadesold global alliance with Mitsubishi that also includes Renault.
Honda was likely looking for a partner to help take the reins after exiting its deal with GM. Likewise, Nissan and Mitsubishi are both struggling to find a foothold in the US, with the former’s operating profits sinking roughly 99 percent in the US last quarter. Americans just aren’t buying Nissans like they used to, and the company’s failures to introduce any hybrids in what is clearly a very hybrid-friendly market is also slowing things down.
It’s not clear what Mitsubishi really brings to the table. The brand has also struggled to introduce any long-range EVs, but that isn’t unique to Japan’s auto industry.

IBM,8980,2024-08-02T18:30:00Z,"What turned IBM from tech titan to cautionary tale Description: Having birthed the personal computer in 1981, the company refused to put its might behind it and used chips and operating system software from two small companies – Intel and Microsoft. It never recovered from that mistake. content: In the heated battle between Microsoft, Google and a clutch of startups for early leadership in artificial intelligence, one name that’s conspicuously missing is IBM’s. Indeed, its absence from all major technological developments of the past two decades belies its status as a tech titan of a previous age and the most admired corporation in America for years. No company could come within sniffing distance of Big Blue’s 80% market share in computers.
But as the cliche goes, the higher you rise, the harder you fall. In February 1992, at the height of its power, IBM shocked investors when it reported revenues of $64.8 billion for 1991, down 6%. This was its first annual sales decline since 1946. With it came a $2.8 billion annual loss, the first in the company’s 80-year history. Coming just a year after General Motors’s $5.6 billion loss, it signalled the end of the American megacorp. Management guru Peter Drucker put it succinctly: “The Fortune 500 is over.""
Also read: Macs give Apple a chunkier India pie
Many of those Fortune 500 companies did eventually recover, but for IBM It was the beginning of the end. Despite major changes, including the unceremonious sacking of CEO John Akers, and layoffs, IBM (US) suffered a net loss of almost $16 billion from 1991 to 1993. The exit of Akers, a quintessential IBM-er, was a clear sign that the days of stability and continuity were over.
Big Blue’s big mistake
Abrupt though it seemed, IBM’s decline had started long before that. Despite having birthed the personal computer in 1981, the company refused to put its might behind it on the grounds that it couldn’t possibly carry out the tasks performed by a mainframe. Its initial sales estimate for PCs was a peak of 400,000. Since the big boys at the company held the tiny machine in disdain, the company violated its own policy and used chips and operating system software from two small companies – Intel and Microsoft, respectively.

That was the year the then-Broncos general manager and football great passed on a chance to take star quarterback Josh Allen and instead with the fifth pick selected Bradley Chubb, who struggled to stay healthy in parts of five seasons in the Mile High City before being traded to the Dolphins.
Allen, of course, has been a dominant quarterback for the Bills after falling to pick No. 7, tallying 22,703 passing yards, 167 passing touchdowns and 53 rushing scores in his first six seasons with the Bills.

The what-ifs still haunt Elway to this day, he revealed during an appearance on the Barstool Sports podcast, “Pardon my Take.”
“Last year I played [golf] with him and I was wondering, ‘How long is it going to take him to realize that I passed on him and took Bradley Chubb instead?’” Elway said. “And it took him two and a half holes to bring it up.
“And I loved him. But it just didn’t work out. He was my type. That was probably my biggest mistake of my GM days, was not taking Josh.”

Meanwhile, Nvidia shares took a hit from a report that the launch of its upcoming AI chips could be delayed by three months due to design flaws, which could impact customers such as Facebook-parent Meta, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft.

District Judge Amit Mehta concluded that 'Google is a monopolist,' pointing to the tech giant's control of about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones. The 'remedy' phase is expected to be protracted, possibly extending into 2026 due to anticipated appeals.

One for the money and three for the show, veteran arena blasters Def Leppard, Journey and Cheap Trick rocked for the aged at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Friday. Toward the end of a long night that was two-thirds successful, Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott sang about still having the power, still having the glory, and “long live rock ‘n’ roll.” This was proud, defiant flag planting on a hill that some people feel is still worth fighting for.
Def Leppard is a British metal band from the 1980s whose radio-friendly hooks and crunch still exhilarate. Is it corporate? Sure, but so is Coca-Cola. Don’t undervalue a proper fizz.
To look over the band’s discography is to remember an era when rock music still ruled. Pyromania, Hysteria, Adrenalize and Euphoria – the album titles read like a list of psychophysiological effects caused by the band’s music.
The performance was as tight as the spandex no doubt in some of the fans’ closets, with Def Leppard’s fun sound and fury filling a Blue Jays baseball stadium where hits have been hard to come by this season. On the set list were Foolin’, Armageddon It, Animal, Bringin’ On the Heartbreak and Photograph.
The finale was 1987′s Pour Some Sugar on Me. “You got the peaches,” Elliott sang, “I got the cream.” Subtlety was never Def Leppard’s bag.
The preceding set from San Francisco’s Journey was much the same, albeit with more filler and time-killing between the familiar material (Stone in Love, Who’s Crying Now, Wheel in the Sky, Don’t Stop Believin’, Any Way You Want It and more.)
With its emotive balladry and squealing guitars, Journey is Broadway’s idea of a rock band. Indeed, the hit stage musical Rock of Ages (named after the Def Leppard song) features a pair of Journey songs.

The Atlanta beverage giant said it will continue to fight and believes it will win the legal dispute stemming from taxes and interest the IRS maintains the company owes from 2007, 2008 and 2009.
“The company looks forward to the opportunity to begin the appellate process and, as part of that process, will pay the agreed-upon liability and interest,” it said in a statement. Coca-Cola spokesperson Scott Leith declined additional comment to The Associated Press.
U.S. Tax Court Judge Albert Lauber on Friday issued a two-sentence decision and order ending his look at the case. The dispute reached court in December 2015, shortly after the company said it notified the IRS that it owed $3.3 billion more in federal taxes and interest for those three years.

In its Friday statement, Coca-Cola accused the IRS of changing how it let the company calculate U.S. income based on profits amounting to more than $9 billion from foreign licensees and affiliates.
An IRS spokesperson did not immediately respond Friday to a telephone message from AP about the case.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in 2015, Coca-Cola said it had been following the same method to calculate its taxable U.S. income from foreign affiliates for nearly 30 years.
In a company quarterly report filed with SEC on Monday, which included guidance to investors, the company said it believes the IRS and Lauber “misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the company’s foreign licensees.”
The publicly traded company said it expected that “some or all of (the $6 billion), plus accrued interest, would be refunded” if Coca-Cola wins its appeal. It has 90 days to file appeal documents.
